    "Once when I was six years old I saw a magnificent picture in a book, called True Stories from  Nature, about the primeval forest.",
    "It was a picture of a boa constrictor in the act of swallowing an  animal.",
    "Here is a copy of the drawing.",
    "In the book it said: \u201cBoa constrictors swallow their prey whole, without chewing it.",
    "After that they  are not able to move, and they sleep through the six months that they need for digestion.\u201d I  pondered deeply, then, over the adventures of the jungle.",
    "And after some work with a coloured  pencil I succeeded in making my first drawing.",
    "My Drawing Number One.",
    "It looked like this:    I showed my masterpiece to the grown-ups, and asked them whether the drawing frightened them.",
    "But they answered: \u201cFrighten?",
    "Why should any one be frightened by a hat?\u201d My drawing was not  a picture of a hat.",
    "It was a picture of a boa constrictor digesting an elephant.",
    "But since the grown-  ups were not able to understand it, I made another drawing: I drew the inside of the boa  constrictor, so that the grown-ups could see it clearly.",
    "They always need to have things explained.",
    "My Drawing Number Two looked like this:      The grown-ups\u2019 response, this time, was to advise me to lay aside my drawings of boa  constrictors, whether from the inside or the outside, and devote myself instead to geography,  history, arithmetic and grammar.",
    "That is why, at the age of six, I gave up what might have been a  magnificent career as a painter.",
    "I had been disheartened by the failure of my Drawing Number  One and my Drawing Number Two.",
    "Grown-ups never understand anything by themselves, and it is  tiresome for children to be always and forever explaining things to them.",
    "So then I chose another profession, and learned to pilot air-planes.",
    "I have flown a little over all  parts of the world; and it is true that geography has been very useful to me.",
    "At a glance I can  distinguish China from Arizona.",
    "If one gets lost in the night, such knowledge is valuable.",
    "In the  course of this life I have had a great many encounters with a great many people who have been  concerned with matters of consequence.",
    "I have lived a great deal among grown-ups.",
    "I have seen  them intimately, close at hand.",
    "And that hasn\u2019t much improved my opinion of them.",
    "Whenever I met one of them who seemed to me at all clear-sighted, I tried the experiment of  showing him my Drawing Number One, which I have always kept.",
    "I would try to find out, so, if this  was a person of true understanding.",
    "But, whoever it was, he, or she, would always say: \u201cThat is a  hat.\u201d Then I would never talk to that person about boa constrictors, or primeval forests, or stars.",
    "I  would bring myself down to his level.",
    "I would talk to him about bridge, and golf, and politics, and  neckties.",
    "And the grown-up would be greatly pleased to have met such a sensible man.",
    "So I lived my life alone, without anyone that I could really talk to, until I had an accident with my  plane in the Desert of Sahara, six years ago.",
    "Something was broken in my engine.",
    "And as I had  with me neither a mechanic nor any passengers, I set myself to attempt the difficult repairs all  alone.",
    "It was a question of life or death for me: I had scarcely enough drinking water to last a  week.",
    "The first night, then, I went to sleep on the sand, a thousand miles from any human habitation.",
    "I  was more isolated than a shipwrecked sailor on a raft in the middle of the ocean.",
    "Thus you can  imagine my amazement, at sunrise, when I was awakened by an odd little voice.",
    "It said: \u201cIf you please, draw me a sheep!\u201d   \u201cWhat!\u201d   \u201cDraw me a sheep!\u201d   I jumped to my feet, completely thunderstruck.",
    "I blinked my eyes hard.",
    "I looked carefully all  around me.",
    "And I saw a most extraordinary small person, who stood there examining me with  great seriousness.",
    "Here you may see the best portrait that, later, I was able to make of him.",
    "But  my drawing is certainly very much less charming than its model.",
    "That, however, is not my fault.",
    "The grown-ups discouraged me in my painter\u2019s career when I was  six years old, and I never learned to draw anything, except boas from the outside and boas from  the inside.",
    "Now I stared at this sudden apparition with my eyes fairly starting out of my head in  astonishment.",
    "Remember, I had crashed in the desert a thousand miles from any inhabited region.",
    "And yet my little man seemed neither to be straying uncertainly among the sands, nor to be  fainting from fatigue or hunger or thirst or fear.",
    "Nothing about him gave any suggestion of a child  lost in the middle of the desert, a thousand miles from any human habitation.",
    "When at last I was able to speak, I said to him: \u201cBut, what are you doing here?\u201d And in answer he  repeated, very slowly, as if he were speaking of a matter of great consequence:   \u201cIf you please, draw me a sheep\u2026\u201d   When a mystery is too overpowering, one dare not disobey.",
    "Absurd as it might seem to me, a  thousand miles from any human habitation and in danger of death, I took out of my pocket a sheet  of paper and my fountain pen.",
    "But then I remembered how my studies had been concentrated on  geography, history, arithmetic, and grammar, and I told the little chap (a little crossly, too) that I  did not know how to draw.",
    "He answered me: \u201cThat doesn\u2019t matter.",
    "Draw me a sheep\u2026\u201d      But I had never drawn a sheep.",
    "So I drew for him one of the two pictures I had drawn so often.",
    "It  was that of the boa constrictor from the outside.",
    "And I was astounded to hear the little fellow  greet it with, \u201cNo, no, no!",
    "I do not want an elephant inside a boa constrictor.",
    "A boa constrictor is a  very dangerous creature, and an elephant is very cumbersome.",
    "Where I live, everything is very  small.",
    "What I need is a sheep.",
    "Draw me a sheep.",
    "So then I made a drawing.",
    "He looked at it carefully, then he said: \u201cNo.",
    "This sheep is already very  sickly.",
    "Make me another.\u201d So I made another drawing.",
    "My friend smiled gently and indulgently.",
    "\u201cYou see yourself,\u201d he said, \u201cthat this is not a sheep.",
    "This is a ram.",
    "It has horns.",
    "So then I did my drawing over once more.",
    "But it was rejected too, just like the others.",
    "\u201cThis one is  too old.",
    "I want a sheep that will live a long time.",
    "By this time my patience was exhausted, because I was in a hurry to start taking my engine apart.",
    "So I tossed off this drawing.",
    "And I threw out an explanation with it.",
    "\u201cThis is only his box.",
    "The sheep you asked for is inside.\u201d      I was very surprised to see a light break over the face of my young judge:   \u201cThat is exactly the way I wanted it!",
    "Do you think that this sheep will have to have a great deal of  grass?\u201d   \u201cWhy?\u201d   \u201cBecause where I live everything is very small\u2026\u201d   \u201cThere will surely be enough grass for him,\u201d I said.",
    "\u201cIt is a very small sheep that I have given you.\u201d   He bent his head over the drawing: \u201cNot so small that, Look!",
    "He has gone to sleep\u2026\u201d   And that is how I made the acquaintance of the little prince.",
    "It took me a long time to learn where he came from.",
    "The little prince, who asked me so many  questions, never seemed to hear the ones I asked him.",
    "It was from words dropped by chance that,  little by little, everything was revealed to me.",
    "The first time he saw my air-plane, for instance (I shall not draw my air-plane; that would be much  too complicated for me), he asked me: \u201cWhat is that object?\u201d   \u201cThat is not an object.",
    "It flies.",
    "It is an air-plane.",
    "It is my air-plane.\u201d And I was proud to have him  learn that I could fly.",
    "He cried out, then: \u201cWhat!",
    "You dropped down from the sky?\u201d     \u201cYes,\u201d I answered, modestly.",
    "\u201cOh!",
    "That is funny!\u201d And the little prince broke into a lovely peal of laughter, which irritated me  very much.",
    "I like my misfortunes to be taken seriously.",
    "Then he added: \u201cSo you, too, come from the sky!",
    "Which is your planet?\u201d At that moment I caught  a gleam of light in the impenetrable mystery of his presence; and I demanded, abruptly: \u201cDo you  come from another planet?\u201d But he did not reply.",
    "He tossed his head gently, without taking his  eyes from my plane: \u201cIt is true that on that you can\u2019t have come from very far away\u2026\u201d And he  sank into a reverie, which lasted a long time.",
    "Then, taking my sheep out of his pocket, he buried  himself in the contemplation of his treasure.",
    "You can imagine how my curiosity was aroused by this half-confidence about the \u201cother planets.\u201d I  made a great effort, therefore, to find out more on this subject.",
    "\u201cMy little man, where do you come from?",
    "What is this \u2018where I live,\u2019 of which you speak?",
    "Where  do you want to take your sheep?\u201d   After a reflective silence he answered: \u201cThe thing that is so good about the box you have given  me is that at night he can use it as his house.\u201d   \u201cThat is so.",
    "And if you are good I will give you a string, too, so that you can tie him during the day,  and a post to tie him to.\u201d   But the little prince seemed shocked by this offer: \u201cTie him!",
    "What a queer idea!\u201d   \u201cBut if you don\u2019t tie him,\u201d I said, \u201che will wander off somewhere, and get lost.\u201d   My friend broke into another peal of laughter: \u201cBut where do you think he would go?\u201d  \u201cAnywhere.",
    "Straight ahead of him.\u201d   Then the little prince said, earnestly: \u201cThat doesn\u2019t matter.",
    "Where I live, everything is so small!\u201d  And, with perhaps a hint of sadness, he added: \u201cStraight ahead of him, nobody can go very far\u2026\u201d      I had thus learned a second fact of great importance: this was that the planet the little prince  came from was scarcely any larger than a house!",
    "But that did not really surprise me much.",
    "I knew  very well that in addition to the great planets, such as the Earth, Jupiter, Mars, Venus, to which  we have given names, there are also hundreds of others, some of which are so small that one has  a hard time seeing them through the telescope.",
    "When an astronomer discovers one of these he does not give it a name, but only a number.",
    "He  might call it, for example, \u201cAsteroid 325.\u201d      I have serious reason to believe that the planet from which the little prince came is the asteroid  known as B-612.",
    "This asteroid has only once been seen through the telescope.",
    "That was by a  Turkish astronomer, in 1909.",
    "On making his discovery, the astronomer had presented it to the International Astronomical  Congress, in a great demonstration.",
    "But he was in Turkish costume, and so nobody would believe  what he said.",
    "Grown-ups are like that\u2026   Fortunately, however, for the reputation of Asteroid B-612, a Turkish dictator made a law that his  subjects, under pain of death, should change to European costume.",
    "So in 1920 the astronomer  gave his demonstration all over again, dressed with impressive style and elegance.",
    "And this time  everybody accepted his report.",
    "If I have told you these details about the asteroid, and made a note of its number for you, it is on  account of the grown-ups and their ways.",
    "When you tell them that you have made a new friend,  they never ask you any questions about essential matters.",
    "They never say to you, \u201cWhat does his  voice sound like?",
    "What games does he love best?",
    "Does he collect butterflies?\u201d Instead, they  demand: \u201cHow old is he?",
    "How many brothers has he?",
    "How much does he weigh?",
    "How much  money does his father make?\u201d   Only from these figures do they think they have learned anything about him.",
    "If you were to say to the grown-ups: \u201cI saw a beautiful house made of rosy brick, with geraniums  in the windows and doves on the roof,\u201d they would not be able to get any idea of that house at all.",
    "You would have to say to them: \u201cI saw a house that cost $ 20,000.\u201d Then they would exclaim: \u201cOh,  what a pretty house that is!\u201d Just so, you might say to them: \u201cThe proof that the little prince  existed is that he was charming, that he laughed, and that he was looking for a sheep.",
    "If anybody  wants a sheep, that is a proof that he exists.\u201d And what good would it do to tell them that?",
    "They  would shrug their shoulders, and treat you like a child.",
    "But if you said to them: \u201cThe planet he  came from is Asteroid B-612,\u201d then they would be convinced, and leave you in peace from their  questions.",
    "They are like that.",
    "One must not hold it against them.",
    "Children should always show  great forbearance toward grown-up people.",
    "But certainly, for us who understand life, figures are a  matter of indifference.",
    "I should have liked to begin this story in the fashion of the fairy-tales.",
    "I should have like to say:  \u201cOnce upon a time there was a little prince who lived on a planet that was scarcely any bigger     than himself, and who had need of a sheep\u2026\u201d     To those who understand life, that would have given a much greater air of truth to my story.",
    "Fori  do not want any one to read my book carelessly.",
    "I have suffered too much grief in setting down  these memories.",
    "Six years have already passed since my friend went away from me, with his  sheep.",
    "If I try to describe him here, it is to make sure that I shall not forget him.",
    "To forget a friend  is sad.",
    "Not every one has had a friend.",
    "And if I forget him, I may become like the grown-ups who  are no longer interested in anything but figures\u2026 It is for that purpose, again, that I have bought a  box of paints and some pencils.",
    "It is hard to take up drawing again at my age, when I have never made any pictures except those  of the boa constrictor from the outside and the boa constrictor from the inside, since I was six.",
    "I  shall certainly try to make my portraits as true to life as possible.",
    "But I am not at all sure of  success.",
    "One drawing goes along all right, and another has no resemblance to its subject.",
    "I make  some errors, too, in the little prince\u2019s height: in one place he is too tall and in another too short.",
    "And I feel some doubts about the colour of his costume.",
    "So I fumble along as best I can, now good,  now bad, and I hope generally fair-to- middling.",
    "In certain more important details I shall make  mistakes, also.",
    "But that is something that will not be my fault.",
    "My friend never explained anything  to me.",
    "He thought, perhaps, that I was like himself.",
    "But I, alas, do not know how to see sheep  through the walls of boxes.",
    "Perhaps I am a little like the grown-ups.",
    "I have had to grow old.",
    "As each day passed I would learn, in our talk, something about the little prince\u2019s planet, his  departure from it, his journey.",
    "The information would come very slowly, as it might chance to fall  from his thoughts.",
    "It was in this way that I heard, on the third day, about the catastrophe of the  baobabs.",
    "This time, once more, I had the sheep to thank for it.",
    "For the little prince asked me abruptly, as if  seized by a grave doubt,   \u201cIt is true, isn\u2019t it, that sheep eat little bushes?\u201d   \u201cYes, that is true.\u201d   \u201cAh!",
    "I am glad!\u201d   I did not understand why it was so important that sheep should eat little bushes.",
    "But the little  prince added: \u201cThen it follows that they also eat baobabs?\u201d I pointed out to the little prince that  baobabs were not little bushes, but, on the contrary, trees as big as castles; and that even if he  took a whole herd of elephants away with him, the herd would not eat up one single baobab.",
    "The idea of the herd of elephants made the little prince laugh.",
    "\u201cWe would have to put them one on  top of the other,\u201d he said.",
    "But he made a wise comment:   \u201cBefore they grow so big, the baobabs start out by being little.\u201d   \u201cThat is strictly correct,\u201d I said.",
    "\u201cBut why do you want the sheep to eat the little baobabs?\u201d   He answered me at once, \u201cOh, come, come!\u201d, as if he were speaking of something that was self-  evident.",
    "And I was obliged to make a great mental effort to solve this problem, without any  assistance.",
    "Indeed, as I learned, there were on the planet where the little prince lived, as on all planets, good       plants and bad plants.",
    "In consequence, there were good seeds from good plants, and bad seeds  from bad plants.",
    "But seeds are invisible.",
    "They sleep deep in the heart of the earth\u2019s darkness,  until some one among them is seized with the desire to awaken.",
    "Then this little seed will stretch  itself and begin, timidly at first, to push a charming little sprig inoffensively upward toward the  sun.",
    "If it is only a sprout of radish or the sprig of a rose-bush, one would let it grow wherever it  might wish.",
    "But when it is a bad plant, one must destroy it as soon as possible, the very first  instant that one recognises it.",
    "Now there were some terrible seeds on the planet that was the home of the little prince; and these  were the seeds of the baobab.",
    "The soil of that planet was infested with them.",
    "A baobab is  something you will never, never be able to get rid of if you attend to it too late.",
    "It spreads over the  entire planet.",
    "It bores clear through it with its roots.",
    "And if the planet is too small, and the  baobabs are too many, they split it in pieces\u2026   \u201cIt is a question of discipline,\u201d the little prince said to me later on.",
    "\u201cWhen you\u2019ve finished your own toilet in the morning, then it is time to attend to the toilet of your  planet, just so, with the greatest care.",
    "You must see to it that you pull up regularly all the baobabs,  at the very first moment when they can be distinguished from the rosebushes, which they  resemble so closely in their earliest youth.",
    "It is very tedious work,\u201d the little prince added, \u201cbut  very easy.\u201d And one day he said to me: \u201cYou ought to make a beautiful drawing, so that the  children where you live can see exactly how all this is.",
    "That would be very useful to them if they  were to travel some day.",
    "Sometimes,\u201d he added, \u201cthere is no harm in putting off a piece of work until another day.",
    "But  when it is a matter of baobabs, that always means a catastrophe.",
    "I knew a planet that was inhabited by a lazy man.",
    "He neglected three little bushes\u2026 So, as the  little prince described it to me, I have made a drawing of that planet.",
    "I do not much like to take  the tone of a moralist.",
    "But the danger of the baobabs is so little understood, and such considerable  risks would be run by anyone who might get lost on an asteroid, that for once I am breaking  through my reserve.",
    "\u201cChildren,\u201d I say plainly, \u201cwatch out for the baobabs!\u201d My friends, like  myself, have been skirting this danger for a long time, without ever knowing it; and so it is for  them that I have worked so hard over this drawing.",
    "The lesson which I pass on by this means is worth all the trouble it has cost me.",
    "Perhaps you will  ask me, \u201cWhy are there no other drawing in this book as magnificent and impressive as this  drawing of the baobabs?\u201d The reply is simple.",
    "I have tried.",
    "But with the others I have not been  successful.",
    "When I made the drawing of the baobabs I was carried beyond myself by the inspiring  force of urgent necessity.",
    "Oh, little prince!",
    "Bit by bit I came to understand the secrets of your sad little life\u2026 For a long time  you had found your only entertainment in the quiet pleasure of looking at the sunset.",
    "I learned that new detail on the morning of the fourth day, when you said to me:   \u201cI am very fond of sunsets.",
    "Come, let us go look at a sunset now.\u201d   \u201cBut we must wait,\u201d I said.",
    "\u201cWait?",
    "For what?\u201d   \u201cFor the sunset.",
    "We must wait until it is time.\u201d   At first you seemed to be very much surprised.",
    "And then you laughed to yourself.",
    "You said to me:  \u201cI am always thinking that I am at home!\u201d   Just so.",
    "Everybody knows that when it is noon in the United States the sun is setting over France.",
    "If you could fly to France in one minute, you could go straight into the sunset, right from noon.",
    "Unfortunately, France is too far away for that.",
    "But on your tiny planet, my little prince, all you  need do is move your chair a few steps.",
    "You can see the day end and the twilight falling whenever  you like\u2026   \u201cOne day,\u201d you said to me, \u201cI saw the sunset forty-four times!\u201d   And a little later you added: \u201cYou know, one loves the sunset, when one is so sad\u2026\u201d \u201cWere you so  sad, then?\u201d I asked, \u201con the day of the forty-four sunsets?\u201d   But the little prince made no reply.",
    "On the fifth day, again, as always, it was thanks to the sheep, the secret of the little prince\u2019s life  was revealed to me.",
    "Abruptly, without anything to lead up to it, and as if the question had been born of long and silent  meditation on his problem, he demanded: \u201cA sheep; if it eats little bushes, does it eat flowers,  too?\u201d      \u201cA sheep,\u201d I answered, \u201ceats anything it finds in its reach.\u201d     \u201cEven flowers that have thorns?\u201d   \u201cYes, even flowers that have thorns.\u201d   \u201cThen the thorns, what use are they?\u201d I did not know.",
    "At that moment I was very busy trying to unscrew a bolt that had got stuck in my engine.",
    "I was  very much worried, for it was becoming clear to me that the breakdown of my plane was  extremely serious.",
    "And I had so little drinking water left that I had to fear for the worst.",
    "\u201cThe thorns, what use are they?\u201d   The little prince never let go of a question, once he had asked it.",
    "As for me, I was upset over that  bolt.",
    "And I answered with the first thing that came into my head: \u201cThe thorns are of no use at all.",
    "Flowers have thorns just for spite!\u201d   \u201cOh!\u201d There was a moment of complete silence.",
    "Then the little prince flashed back at me, with a kind of resentfulness: \u201cI don\u2019t believe you!",
    "Flowers are weak creatures.",
    "They are naive.",
    "They reassure themselves as best they can.",
    "They  believe that their thorns are terrible weapons\u2026\u201d   I did not answer.",
    "At that instant I was saying to myself: \u201cIf this bolt still won\u2019t turn, I am going to  knock it out with the hammer.\u201d   Again the little prince disturbed my thoughts.",
    "\u201cAnd you actually believe that the flowers\u2026\u201d   \u201cOh, no!\u201d I cried.",
    "\u201cNo, no no!",
    "I don\u2019t believe anything.",
    "I answered you with the first thing that  came into my head.",
    "Don\u2019t you see, I am very busy with matters of consequence!\u201d   He stared at me, thunderstruck.",
    "\u201cMatters of consequence!\u201d   He looked at me there, with my hammer in my hand, my fingers black with engine grease, bending  down over an object which seemed to him extremely ugly\u2026   \u201cYou talk just like the grown-ups!\u201d That made me a little ashamed.",
    "But he went on, relentlessly:  \u201cYou mix everything up together\u2026 You confuse everything\u2026\u201d   He was really very angry.",
    "He tossed his golden curls in the breeze.",
    "\u201cI know a planet where there is a certain red-faced gentleman.",
    "He has never smelled a flower.",
    "He  has never looked at a star.",
    "He has never loved any one.",
    "He has never done anything in his life but  add up figures.",
    "And all day he says over and over, just like you: \u2018I am busy with matters of  consequence!\u2019 And that makes him swell up with pride.",
    "\u201cBut he is not a man, he is a mushroom!\u201d     \u201cA what?\u201d     \u201cA mushroom!\u201d The little prince was now white with rage.",
    "\u201cThe flowers have been growing thorns  for millions of years.",
    "For millions of years the sheep have been eating them just the same.",
    "And is  it not a matter of consequence to try to understand why the flowers go to so much trouble to grow      ' '   I \\      thorns, which are never of any use to them?",
    "Is the warfare between the sheep and the flowers not  important?",
    "Is this not of more consequence than a fat red-faced gentleman\u2019s sums?",
    "And if I know,  I, myself, one flower which is unique in the world, which grows nowhere but on my planet, but  which one little sheep can destroy in a single bite some morning, without even noticing what he is  doing, Oh!",
    "You think that is not important!",
    "His face turned from white to red as he continued: \u201cIf  some one loves a flower, of which just one single blossom grows in all the millions and millions of  stars, it is enough to make him happy just to look at the stars.",
    "He can say to himself, \u2018Somewhere, my flower is there\u2026\u2019 But if the sheep eats the flower, in one  moment all his stars will be darkened\u2026 And you think that is not important!\u201d   He could not say anything more.",
    "His words were choked by sobbing.",
    "The night had fallen.",
    "I had  let my tools drop from my hands.",
    "Of what moment now was my hammer, my bolt, or thirst, or  death?",
    "On one star, one planet, my planet, the Earth, there was a little prince to be comforted.",
    "I  took him in my arms, and rocked him.",
    "I said to him: \u201cThe flower that you love is not in danger.",
    "I  will draw you a muzzle for your sheep.",
    "I will draw you a railing to put around your flower.",
    "I will\u2026\u201d   I did not know what to say to him.",
    "I felt awkward and blundering.",
    "I did not know how I could reach  him, where I could overtake him and go on hand in hand with him once more.",
    "It is such a secret place, the land of tears.",
    "I soon learned to know this flower better.",
    "On the little prince\u2019s planet the flowers had always been  very simple.",
    "They had only one ring of petals; they took up no room at all; they were a trouble to  nobody.",
    "One morning they would appear in the grass, and by night they would have faded  peacefully away.",
    "But one day, from a seed blown from no one knew where, a new flower had come  up; and the little prince had watched very closely over this small sprout which was not like any  other small sprouts on his planet.",
    "It might, you see, have been a new kind of baobab.",
    "The shrub soon stopped growing, and began to  get ready to produce a flower.",
    "The little prince, who was present at the first appearance of a huge  bud, felt at once that some sort of miraculous apparition must emerge from it.",
    "But the flower was  not satisfied to complete the preparations for her beauty in the shelter of her green chamber.",
    "She     chose her colours with the greatest care.",
    "She adjusted her petals one by one.",
    "She did not wish to  go out into the world all rumpled, like the field poppies.",
    "It was only in the full radiance of her  beauty that she wished to appear.",
    "Oh, yes!",
    "She was a coquettish creature!",
    "And her mysterious  adornment lasted for days and days.",
    "Then one morning, exactly at sunrise, she suddenly showed  herself.",
    "And, after working with all this painstaking precision, she yawned and said: \u201cAh!",
    "I am  scarcely awake.",
    "I beg that you will excuse me.",
    "My petals are still all disarranged\u2026\u201d But the little  prince could not restrain his admiration:   \u201cOh!",
    "How beautiful you are!\u201d   \u201cAm I not?\u201d the flower responded, sweetly.",
    "\u201cAnd I was born at the same moment as the sun\u2026\u201d   The little prince could guess easily enough that she was not any too modest, but how moving, and  exciting she was!",
    "\u201cI think it is time for breakfast,\u201d she added an instant later.",
    "\u201cIf you would have the kindness to  think of my needs\u201d And the little prince, completely abashed, went to look for a sprinkling can of  fresh water.",
    "So, he tended the flower.",
    "So, too, she began very quickly to torment him with her vanity, which  was, if the truth be known, a little difficult to deal with.",
    "One day, for instance, when she was speaking of her four thorns, she said to the little prince: \u201cLet  the tigers come with their claws!\u201d   \u201cThere are no tigers on my planet,\u201d the little prince objected.",
    "\u201cAnd, anyway, tigers do not eat  weeds.\u201d   \u201cI am not a weed,\u201d the flower replied, sweetly.",
    "\u201cPlease excuse me\u2026\u201d \u201cI am not at all afraid of  tigers,\u201d she went on, \u201cbut I have a horror of drafts.",
    "I suppose you wouldn\u2019t screen for me?\"   \u201cA horror of drafts, that is bad luck, for a plant,\u201d remarked the little prince, and added to himself,  \u201cThis flower is a very complex creature\u2026\u201d   \u201cAt night I want you to put me under a glass globe.",
    "It is very cold where you live.",
    "In the place I  came from\u2026\u201d But she interrupted herself at that point.",
    "She had come in the form of a seed.",
    "She  could not have known anything of any other worlds.",
    "Embarrassed over having let herself be caught on the verge of such an untruth, she coughed two  or three times, in order to put the little prince in the wrong.",
    "\u201cThe screen?\u201d   \u201cI was just going to look for it when you spoke to me\u2026\u201d   Then she forced her cough a little more so that he should suffer from remorse just the same.",
    "So  the little prince, in spite of all the good will that was inseparable from his love, had soon come to  doubt her.",
    "He had taken seriously words which were without importance, and it made him very  unhappy.",
    "\u201cI ought not to have listened to her,\u201d he confided to me one day.",
    "\u201cOne never ought to listen to the flowers.",
    "One should simply look at them and breathe their      fragrance.",
    "Mine perfumed all my planet.",
    "But I did not know how to take pleasure in all her grace.",
    "This tale of claws, which disturbed me so much, should only have filled my heart with tenderness  and pity.\u201d   And he continued his confidences: \u201cThe fact is that I did not know how to understand anything!",
    "I  ought to have judged by deeds and not by words.",
    "She cast her fragrance and her radiance over  me.",
    "I ought never to have run away from her\u2026 I ought to have guessed all the affection that lay  behind her poor little stratagems.",
    "Flowers are so inconsistent!",
    "But I was too young to know how to  love her\u2026\u201d   I believe that for his escape he took advantage of the migration of a flock of wild birds.",
    "On the  morning of his departure he put his planet in perfect order.",
    "He carefully cleaned out his active  volcanoes.",
    "He possessed two active volcanoes; and they were very convenient for heating his  breakfast in the morning.",
    "He also had one volcano that was extinct.",
    "But, as he said, \u201cOne never  knows!\u201d So he cleaned out the extinct volcano, too.",
    "If they are well cleaned out, volcanoes burn  slowly and steadily, without any eruptions.",
    "Volcanic eruptions are like fires in a chimney.",
    "On our earth we are obviously much too small to clean out our volcanoes.",
    "That is why they bring  no end of trouble upon us.",
    "The little prince also pulled up, with a certain sense of dejection, the  last little shoots of the baobabs.",
    "He believed that he would never want to return.",
    "But on this last  morning all these familiar tasks seemed very precious to him.",
    "And when he watered the flower for  the last time, and prepared to place her under the shelter of her glass globe, he realised that he  was very close to tears.",
    "\u201cGoodbye,\u201d he said to the flower.",
    "But she made no answer.",
    "\u201cGoodbye,\u201d  he said again.",
    "The flower coughed.",
    "But it was not because she had a cold.",
    "\u201cI have been silly,\u201d she said to him, at last.",
    "\u201cI ask your forgiveness.",
    "Try to be happy\u2026\u201d He was  surprised by this absence of reproaches.",
    "He stood there all bewildered, the glass globe held  arrested in mid-air.",
    "He did not understand this quiet sweetness.",
    "\u201cOf course I love you,\u201d the flower said to him.",
    "\u201cIt is my fault that you have not known it all the  while.",
    "That is of no importance.",
    "But you, you have been just as foolish as I.",
    "Try to be happy\u2026 let  the glass globe be.",
    "I don\u2019t want it any more.\u201d   \u201cBut the wind\u2026\u201d \u201cMy cold is not so bad as all that\u2026 the cool night air will do me good.",
    "I am a  flower.\u201d   \u201cBut the animals\u2026\u201d \u201cWell, I must endure the presence of two or three caterpillars if I wish to  become acquainted with the butterflies.",
    "It seems that they are very beautiful.",
    "And if not the  butterflies and the caterpillars who will call upon me?",
    "You will be far away\u2026 as for the large  animals, I am not at all afraid of any of them.",
    "I have my claws.\u201d   And, naively, she showed her four thorns.",
    "Then she added: \u201cDon\u2019t linger like this.",
    "You have decided to go away.",
    "Now go!\u201d   For she did not want him to see her crying.",
    "She was such a proud flower\u2026     He found himself in the neighbourhood of the asteroids 325, 326, 327, 328, 329, and 330.",
    "He  began, therefore, by visiting them, in order to add to his knowledge.",
    "The first of them was  inhabited by a king.",
    "Clad in royal purple and ermine, he was seated upon a throne, which was at      the same time both simple and majestic.",
    "\u201cAh!",
    "Here is a subject,\u201d exclaimed the king, when he saw the little prince coming.",
    "And the little  prince asked himself: \u201cHow could he recognise me when he had never seen me before?\u201d   He did not know how the world is simplified for kings.",
    "To them, all men are subjects.",
    "\u201cApproach,  so that I may see you better,\u201d said the king, who felt consumingly proud of being at last a king  over somebody.",
    "The little prince looked everywhere to find a place to sit down; but the entire planet was crammed  and obstructed by the king\u2019s magnificent ermine robe.",
    "So he remained standing upright, and, since  he was tired, he yawned.",
    "\u201cIt is contrary to etiquette to yawn in the presence of a king,\u201d the monarch said to him.",
    "\u201cI forbid  you to do so.\u201d   \u201cI can\u2019t help it.",
    "I can\u2019t stop myself,\u201d replied the little prince, thoroughly embarrassed.",
    "\u201cI have come on a long journey, and I have had no sleep\u2026\u201d   \u201cAh, then,\u201d the king said.",
    "\u201cI order you to yawn.",
    "It is years since I have seen anyone yawning.",
    "Yawns, to me, are objects of curiosity.",
    "Come, now!",
    "Yawn again!",
    "It is an order.\u201d   \u201cThat frightens me\u2026 I cannot, any more\u2026\u201d murmured the little prince, now completely abashed.",
    "\u201cHum!",
    "Hum!\u201d replied the king.",
    "\u201cThen I\u2026 I order you sometimes to yawn and sometimes to\u201d He  sputtered a little, and seemed vexed.",
    "For what the king fundamentally insisted upon was that his  authority should be respected.",
    "He tolerated no disobedience.",
    "He was an absolute monarch.",
    "But,  because he was a very good man, he made his orders reasonable.",
    "\u201cIf I ordered a general,\u201d he would say, by way of example, \u201cif I ordered a general to change  himself into a sea bird, and if the general did not obey me, that would not be the fault of the  general.",
    "It would be my fault.\u201d   \u201cMay I sit down?\u201d came now a timid inquiry from the little prince.",
    "\u201cI order you to do so,\u201d the king  answered him, and majestically gathered in a fold of his ermine mantle.",
    "But the little prince was  wondering\u2026 The planet was tiny.",
    "Over what could this king really rule?",
    "\u201cSire,\u201d he said to him, \u201cI beg that you will excuse my asking you a question\u201d   \u201cI order you to ask me a question,\u201d the king hastened to assure him.",
    "\u201cSire, over what do you  rule?\u201d \u201cOver everything,\u201d said the king, with magnificent simplicity.",
    "\u201cOver everything?\u201d The king made a gesture, which took in his planet, the other planets, and all  the stars.",
    "\u201cOver all that?\u201d asked the little prince.",
    "\u201cOver all that,\u201d the king answered.",
    "For his rule  was not only absolute: it was also universal.",
    "\u201cAnd the stars obey you?\u201d \u201cCertainly they do,\u201d the  king said.",
    "\u201cThey obey instantly.",
    "I do not permit insubordination.\u201d   Such power was a thing for the little prince to marvel at.",
    "If he had been master of such complete  authority, he would have been able to watch the sunset, not forty-four times in one day, but  seventy-two, or even a hundred, or even two hundred times, with out ever having to move his  chair.",
    "And because he felt a bit sad as he remembered his little planet, which he had forsaken, he  plucked up his courage to ask the king a favour:       \u201cI should like to see a sunset\u2026 do me that kindness\u2026 Order the sun to set\u2026\u201d   \u201cIf I ordered a general to fly from one flower to another like a butterfly, or to write a tragic  drama, or to change himself into a sea bird, and if the general did not carry out the order that he  had received, which one of us would be in the wrong?\u201d the king demanded.",
    "\u201cThe general, or  myself?\u201d   \u201cYou,\u201d said the little prince firmly.",
    "\u201cExactly.",
    "One much require from each one the duty which each one can perform,\u201d the king went  on.",
    "\u201cAccepted authority rests first of all on reason.",
    "If you ordered your people to go and throw  themselves into the sea, they would rise up in revolution.",
    "I have the right to require obedience  because my orders are reasonable.\u201d   \u201cThen my sunset?\u201d the little prince reminded him: for he never forgot a question once he had  asked it.",
    "\u201cYou shall have your sunset.",
    "I shall command it.",
    "But, according to my science of government, I  shall wait until conditions are favourable.\u201d   \u201cWhen will that be?\u201d inquired the little prince.",
    "\u201cHum!",
    "Hum!\u201d replied the king; and before saying  anything else he consulted a bulky almanac.",
    "\u201cHum!",
    "Hum!",
    "That will be about\u2026 about\u2026 that will be  this evening about twenty minutes to eight.",
    "And you will see how well I am obeyed.\u201d   The little prince yawned.",
    "He was regretting his lost sunset.",
    "And then, too, he was already  beginning to be a little bored.",
    "\u201cI have nothing more to do here,\u201d he said to the king.",
    "\u201cSo I shall set  out on my way again.\u201d \u201cDo not go,\u201d said the king, who was very proud of having a subject.",
    "\u201cDo  not go.",
    "I will make you a Minister!\u201d \u201cMinister of what?\u201d \u201cMinster of\u2026of Justice!\u201d \u201cBut there is  nobody here to judge!\u201d \u201cWe do not know that,\u201d the king said to him.",
    "\u201cI have not yet made a  complete tour of my kingdom.",
    "I am very old.",
    "There is no room here for a carriage.",
    "And it tires me  to walk.\u201d \u201cOh, but I have looked already!\u201d said the little prince, turning around to give one more  glance to the other side of the planet.",
    "On that side, as on this, there was nobody at all\u2026 \u201cThen you shall judge yourself,\u201d the king  answered, \u201cthat is the most difficult thing of all.",
    "It is much more difficult to j udge oneself than to  j udge others.",
    "If you succeed in j udging yourself rightly, then you are indeed a man of true  wisdom.\u201d     \u201cYes,\u201d said the little prince, \u201cbut I can judge myself anywhere.",
    "I do not need to live on this planet.",
    "\u201cHum!",
    "Hum!\u201d said the king.",
    "\u201cI have good reason to believe that somewhere on my planet there is  an old rat.",
    "I hear him at night.",
    "You can judge this old rat.",
    "From time to time you will condemn him  to death.",
    "Thus his life will depend on your j ustice.",
    "But you will pardon him on each occasion; for  he must be treated thriftily.",
    "He is the only one we have.\u201d   \u201cI,\u201d replied the little prince, \u201cdo not like to condemn anyone to death.",
    "And now I think I will go on  my way.\u201d \u201cNo,\u201d said the king.",
    "But the little prince, having now completed his preparations for  departure, had no wish to grieve the old monarch.",
    "\u201cIf Your Majesty wishes to be promptly  obeyed,\u201d he said, \u201che should be able to give me a reasonable order.",
    "He should be able, for  example, to order me to be gone by the end of one minute.",
    "It seems to me that conditions are  favourable\u2026\u201d As the king made no answer, the little prince hesitated a moment.",
    "Then, with a sigh, he took his leave.",
    "\u201cI made you my Ambassador,\u201d the king called out, hastily.",
    "He had a magnificent air of authority.",
    "\u201cThe grown-ups are very strange,\u201d the little prince said to himself, as he continued on his journey.",
    "The second planet was inhabited by a conceited man.",
    "\u201cAh!",
    "Ah!",
    "I am about to receive a visit from an admirer!\u201d he exclaimed from afar, when he first  saw the little prince coming.",
    "For, to conceited men, all other men are admirers.",
    "\u201cGood morning,\u201d said the little prince.",
    "\u201cThat is a queer hat you are wearing.\u201d   \u201cIt is a hat for salutes,\u201d the conceited man replied.",
    "\u201cIt is to raise in salute when people acclaim  me.",
    "Unfortunately, nobody at all ever passes this way.\u201d   \u201cYes?\u201d said the little prince, who did not understand what the conceited man was talking about.",
    "\u201cClap your hands, one against the other,\u201d the conceited man now directed him.",
    "The little prince  clapped his hands.",
    "The conceited man raised his hat in a modest salute.",
    "\u201cThis is more entertaining  than the visit to the king,\u201d the little prince said to himself.",
    "And he began again to clap his hands,  one against the other.",
    "The conceited man against raised his hat in salute.",
    "After five minutes of     this exercise the little prince grew tired of the game\u2019s monotony.",
    "\u201cAnd what should one do to  make the hat come down?\u201d he asked.",
    "But the conceited man did not hear him.",
    "Conceited people  never hear anything but praise.",
    "\u201cDo you really admire me very much?\u201d he demanded of the little prince.",
    "\u201cWhat does that mean,  \u2018admire\u2019?\u201d   \u201cTo admire means that you regard me as the handsomest, the best-dressed, the richest, and the  most intelligent man on this planet.\u201d \u201cBut you are the only man on your planet!\u201d \u201cDo me this  kindness.",
    "Admire me just the same.\u201d   \u201cI admire you,\u201d said the little prince, shrugging his shoulders slightly, \u201cbut what is there in that to  interest you so much?\u201d   And the little prince went away.",
    "\u201cThe grown-ups are certainly very odd,\u201d he said to himself, as he  continued on his journey.",
    "The next planet was inhabited by a tippler.",
    "This was a very short visit, but it plunged the little prince into deep dejection.",
    "\u201cWhat are you  doing there?\u201d he said to the tippler, whom he found settled down in silence before a collection of  empty bottles and also a collection of full bottles.",
    "\u201cI am drinking,\u201d replied the tippler, with a lugubrious air.",
    "\u201cWhy are you drinking?\u201d demanded the little prince.",
    "\u201cSo that I may forget,\u201d replied the tippler.",
    "\u201cForget what?\u201d inquired the little prince, who already  was sorry for him.",
    "\u201cForget that I am ashamed,\u201d the tippler confessed, hanging his head.",
    "\u201cAshamed of what?\u201d insisted the little prince, who wanted to help him.",
    "\u201cAshamed of drinking!\u201d The tippler brought his speech to an end, and shut himself up in an  impregnable silence.",
    "And the little prince went away, puzzled.",
    "\u201cThe grown-ups are certainly very, very odd,\u201d he said to  himself, as he continued on his journey.",
    "The fourth planet belonged to a businessman.",
    "This man was so much occupied that he did not even raise his head at the little prince\u2019s arrival.",
    "\u201cGood morning,\u201d the little prince said to him.",
    "\u201cYour cigarette has gone out.\u201d     \u201cThree and two make five.",
    "Five and seven make twelve.",
    "Twelve and three make fifteen.",
    "Good  morning.",
    "Fifteen and seven make twenty-two.",
    "Twenty-two and six make twenty-eight.",
    "I haven\u2019t  time to light it again.",
    "Twenty-six and five make thirty-one.",
    "Phew !",
    "Then that makes five-hundred-  and-one-million, six-hundred-twenty-two-thousand, seven-hundred-thirty-one.\u201d   \u201cFive hundred million what?\u201d asked the little prince.",
    "\u201cEh?",
    "Are you still there?",
    "Five-hundred-and-  one million, I can\u2019t stop\u2026 I have so much to do!",
    "I am concerned with matters of consequence.",
    "I  don\u2019t amuse myself with balderdash.",
    "Two and five make seven\u2026\u201d   \u201cFive-hundred-and-one million what?\u201d repeated the little prince, who never in his life had let go of  a question once he had asked it.",
    "The businessman raised his head.",
    "\u201cDuring the fifty-four years that I have inhabited this planet, I  have been disturbed only three times.",
    "The first time was twenty-two years ago, when some giddy  goose fell from goodness knows where.",
    "He made the most frightful noise that resounded all over  the place, and I made four mistakes in my addition.",
    "The second time, eleven years ago, I was  disturbed by an attack of rheumatism.",
    "I don\u2019t get enough exercise.",
    "I have no time for loafing.",
    "The  third time, well, this is it!",
    "I was saying, then, five -hundred-and-one millions\u201d   \u201cMillions of what?\u201d The businessman suddenly realised that there was no hope of being left in  peace until he answered this question.",
    "\u201cMillions of those little objects,\u201d he said, \u201cwhich one sometimes sees in the sky.\u201d \u201cFlies?\u201d \u201cOh,  no.",
    "Little glittering objects.\u201d \u201cBees?\u201d \u201cOh, no.",
    "Little golden objects that set lazy men to idle  dreaming.",
    "As for me, I am concerned with matters of consequence.",
    "There is no time for idle  dreaming in my life.\u201d \u201cAh!",
    "You mean the stars?\u201d \u201cYes, that\u2019s it.",
    "The stars.\u201d \u201cAnd what do you do  with five-hundred millions of stars?\u201d \u201cFive-hundred-and-one million, six-hundred-twenty-two  thousand, seven-hundred-thirty-one.",
    "I am concerned with matters of consequence: I am  accurate.\u201d   \u201cAnd what do you do with these stars?\u201d \u201cWhat do I do with them?\u201d \u201cYes.\u201d \u201cNothing.",
    "I own them.\u201d  \u201cYou own the stars?\u201d \u201cYes.\u201d \u201cBut I have already seen a king who\u2026\u201d \u201cKings do not own, they  reign over.",
    "It is a very different matter.\u201d   \u201cAnd what good does it do you to own the stars?\u201d \u201cIt does me the good of making me rich.\u201d   \u201cAnd what good does it do you to be rich?\u201d   \u201cIt makes it possible for me to buy more stars, if any are ever discovered.\u201d   \u201cThis man,\u201d the little prince said to himself, \u201creasons a little like my poor tippler\u2026\u201d Nevertheless,  he still had some more questions.",
    "\u201cHow is it possible for one to own the stars?\u201d \u201cTo whom do they  belong?\u201d the businessman retorted, peevishly.",
    "\u201cI don\u2019t know.",
    "To nobody.\u201d \u201cThen they belong to  me, because I was the first person to think of it.\u201d \u201cIs that all that is necessary?\u201d \u201cCertainly.",
    "When you find a diamond that belongs to nobody, it is yours.",
    "When you discover an island that  belongs to nobody, it is yours.",
    "When you get an idea before any one else, you take out a patent on  it: it is yours.",
    "So with me: I own the stars, because nobody else before me ever thought of owning  them.\u201d   \u201cYes, that is true,\u201d said the little prince.",
    "\u201cAnd what do you do with them?\u201d      \u201cI administer them,\u201d replied the businessman.",
    "\u201cI count them and recount them.",
    "It is difficult.",
    "But I  am a man who is naturally interested in matters of consequence.\u201d   The little prince was still not satisfied.",
    "\u201cIf I owned a silk scarf,\u201d he said, \u201cI could put it around my  neck and take it away with me.",
    "If I owned a flower, I could pluck that flower and take it away with  me.",
    "But you cannot pluck the stars from heaven\u2026\u201d   \u201cNo.",
    "But I can put them in the bank.\u201d \u201cWhatever does that mean?\u201d \u201cThat means that I write the  number of my stars on a little paper.",
    "And then I put this paper in a drawer and lock it with a key.\u201d   \u201cAnd that is all?\u201d   \u201cThat is enough,\u201d said the businessman.",
    "\u201cIt is entertaining,\u201d thought the little prince.",
    "\u201cIt is rather poetic.",
    "But it is of no great  consequence.\u201d On matters of consequence, the little prince had ideas, which were very different  from those of the grown-ups.",
    "\u201cI myself own a flower,\u201d he continued his conversation with the businessman, \u201cwhich I water  every day.",
    "I own three volcanoes, which I clean out every week (for I also clean out the one that is  extinct; one never knows).",
    "It is of some use to my volcanoes, and it is of some use to my flower,  that I own them.",
    "But you are of no use to the stars\u2026\u201d   The businessman opened his mouth, but he found nothing to say in answer.",
    "And the little prince  went away.",
    "\u201cThe grown-ups are certainly altogether extraordinary,\u201d he said simply, talking to  himself as he continued on his journey.",
    "The fifth planet was very strange.",
    "It was the smallest of all.",
    "There was just enough room on it for  a street lamp and a lamplighter.",
    "The little prince was not able to reach any explanation of the use of a street lamp and a  lamplighter, somewhere in the heavens, on a planet, which had no people, and not one house.",
    "But he said to himself, nevertheless: \u201cIt may well be that this man is absurd.",
    "But he is not so  absurd as the king, the conceited man, the businessman, and the tippler.",
    "For at least his work has     some meaning.",
    "When he lights his street lamp, it is as if he brought one more star to life, or one  flower.",
    "When he puts out his lamp, he sends the flower, or the star, to sleep.",
    "That is a beautiful  occupation.",
    "And since it is beautiful, it is truly useful.\u201d   When he arrived on the planet he respectfully saluted the lamplighter.",
    "\u201cGood morning.",
    "Why have you just put out your lamp?\u201d   \u201cThose are the orders,\u201d replied the lamplighter.",
    "\u201cGood morning.\u201d   \u201cWhat are the orders?\u201d   \u201cThe orders are that I put out my lamp.",
    "Good evening.\u201d And he lighted his lamp again.",
    "\u201cBut why  have you just lighted it again?\u201d   \u201cThose are the orders,\u201d replied the lamplighter.",
    "\u201cI do not understand,\u201d said the little prince.",
    "\u201cThere is nothing to understand,\u201d said the lamplighter.",
    "\u201cOrders are orders.",
    "Good morning.\u201d And  he put out his lamp.",
    "Then he mopped his forehead with a handkerchief decorated with red squares.",
    "\u201cI follow a terrible profession.",
    "In the old days it was reasonable.",
    "I put the lamp out in the morning,  and in the evening I lighted it again.",
    "I had the rest of the day for relaxation and the rest of the  night for sleep.\u201d   \u201cAnd the orders have been changed since that time?\u201d   \u201cThe orders have not been changed,\u201d said the lamplighter.",
    "\u201cThat is the tragedy!",
    "From year to  year the planet has turned more rapidly and the orders have not been changed!\u201d   \u201cThen what?\u201d asked the little prince.",
    "\u201cThen the planet now makes a complete turn every minute, and I no longer have a single second  for repose.",
    "Once every minute I have to light my lamp and put it out!\u201d   \u201cThat is very funny!",
    "A day lasts only one minute, here where you live!\u201d   \u201cIt is not funny at all!\u201d said the lamplighter.",
    "\u201cWhile we have been talking together a month has  gone by.\u201d   \u201cA month?\u201d     \u201cYes, a month.",
    "Thirty minutes.",
    "Thirty days.",
    "Good evening.\u201d And he lighted his lamp again.",
    "As the  little prince watched him, he felt that he loved this lamplighter who was so faithful to his orders.",
    "He remembered the sunsets, which he himself had gone to seek, in other days, merely by pulling  up his chair; and he wanted to help his friend.",
    "\u201cYou know,\u201d he said, \u201cI can tell you a way you can rest whenever you want to\u2026\u201d   \u201cI always want to rest,\u201d said the lamplighter.",
    "For it is possible for a man to be faithful and lazy at  the same time.",
    "The little prince went on with his explanation: \u201cYour planet is so small that three strides will take  you all the way around it.",
    "To be always in the sunshine, you need only walk along rather slowly.",
    "When you want to rest, you will walk and the day will last as long as you like.\u201d   \u201cThat doesn\u2019t do me much good,\u201d said the lamplighter.",
    "\u201cThe one thing I love in life is to sleep.\u201d   \u201cThen you\u2019re unlucky,\u201d said the little prince.",
    "\u201cI am unlucky,\u201d said the lamplighter.",
    "\u201cGood morning.\u201d And he put out his lamp.",
    "\u201cThat man,\u201d said the little prince to himself, as he continued farther on his journey, \u201cthat man  would be scorned by all the others: by the king, by the conceited man, by the tippler, by the  businessman.",
    "Nevertheless he is the only one of them all who does not seem to me ridiculous.",
    "Perhaps that is because he is thinking of something else besides himself.\u201d   He breathed a sigh of regret, and said to himself, again: \u201cThat man is the only one of them all  whom I could have made my friend.",
    "But his planet is indeed too small.",
    "There is no room on it for  two people\u2026\u201d What the little prince did not dare confess was that he was sorry most of all to leave  this planet, because it was blest every day with 1440 sunsets!",
    "The sixth planet was ten times larger than the last one.",
    "It was inhabited by an old gentleman who  wrote voluminous books.",
    "\u201cOh, look!",
    "Here is an explorer!\u201d he exclaimed to himself when he saw the little prince coming.",
    "The little prince sat down on the table and panted a little.",
    "He had already travelled so much and  so far!",
    "\u201cWhere do you come from?\u201d the old gentleman said to him.",
    "\u201cWhat is that big book?\u201d said the little prince.",
    "\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d   \u201cI am a geographer,\u201d the old gentleman said to him.",
    "\u201cWhat is a geographer?\u201d asked the little prince.",
    "\u201cA geographer is a scholar who knows the  location of all the seas, rivers, towns, mountains, and deserts.\u201d   \u201cThat is very interesting,\u201d said the little prince.",
    "\u201cHere at last is a man who has a real profession!\u201d  And he cast a look around him at the planet of the geographer.",
    "It was the most magnificent and stately planet that he had ever seen.",
    "\u201cYour planet is very beautiful,\u201d he said.",
    "\u201cHas it any oceans?\u201d   \u201cI couldn\u2019t tell you,\u201d said the geographer.",
    "\u201cAh!\u201d The little prince was disappointed.",
    "\u201cHas it any mountains?\u201d   \u201cI couldn\u2019t tell you,\u201d said the geographer.",
    "\u201cAnd towns, and rivers, and deserts?\u201d   \u201cI couldn\u2019t tell you that, either.\u201d   \u201cBut you are a geographer!\u201d   \u201cExactly,\u201d the geographer said.",
    "\u201cBut I am not an explorer.",
    "I haven\u2019t a single explorer on my  planet.",
    "It is not the geographer who goes out to count the towns, the rivers, the mountains, the  seas, the oceans, and the deserts.",
    "The geographer is much too important to go loafing about.",
    "He  does not leave his desk.",
    "But he receives the explorers in his study.",
    "He asks them questions, and  he notes down what they recall of their travels.",
    "And if the recollections of any one among them  seem interesting to him, the geographer orders an inquiry into that explorer\u2019s moral character.\u201d   \u201cWhy is that?\u201d   \u201cBecause an explorer who told lies would bring disaster on the books of the geographer.",
    "So would  an explorer who drank too much.\u201d   \u201cWhy is that?\u201d asked the little prince.",
    "\u201cBecause intoxicated men see double.",
    "Then the geographer would note down two mountains in a  place where there was only one.\u201d   \u201cI know some one,\u201d said the little prince, \u201cwho would make a bad explorer.\u201d   \u201cThat is possible.",
    "Then, when the moral character of the explorer is shown to be good, an inquiry  is ordered into his discovery.\u201d   \u201cOne goes to see it?\u201d   \u201cNo.",
    "That would be too complicated.",
    "But one requires the explorer to furnish proofs.",
    "For example,  if the discovery in question is that of a large mountain, one requires that large stones be brought  back from it.\u201d The geographer was suddenly stirred to excitement.",
    "\u201cBut you come from far away!",
    "You are an explorer!",
    "You shall describe your planet to me!\u201d And, having opened his big register,  the geographer sharpened his pencil.",
    "The recitals of explorers are put down first in pencil.",
    "One  waits until the explorer has furnished proofs, before putting them down in ink.",
    "\u201cWell?\u201d said the  geographer expectantly.",
    "\u201cOh, where I live,\u201d said the little prince, \u201cit is not very interesting.",
    "It is all so small.",
    "I have three  volcanoes.",
    "Two volcanoes are active and the other is extinct.",
    "But one never knows.\u201d   \u201cOne never knows,\u201d said the geographer.",
    "\u201cI have also a flower.\u201d      \u201cWe do not record flowers,\u201d said the geographer.",
    "\u201cWhy is that?",
    "The flower is the most beautiful thing on my planet!\u201d   \u201cWe do not record them,\u201d said the geographer, \u201cbecause they are ephemeral.\u201d   \u201cWhat does that mean \u2018ephemeral\u2019?\u201d   \u201cGeographies,\u201d said the geographer, \u201care the books which, of all books, are most concerned with  matters of consequence.",
    "They never become old-fashioned.",
    "It is very rarely that a mountain  changes its position.",
    "It is very rarely that an ocean empties itself of its waters.",
    "We write of eternal  things.\u201d   \u201cBut extinct volcanoes may come to life again,\u201d the little prince interrupted.",
    "\u201cWhat does that mean \u2018ephemeral\u2019?\u201d   \u201cWhether volcanoes are extinct or alive, it comes to the same thing for us,\u201d said the geographer.",
    "\u201cThe thing that matters to us is the mountain.",
    "It does not change.\u201d   \u201cBut what does that mean \u2018ephemeral\u2019?\u201d repeated the little prince, who never in his life had let go  of a question, once he had asked it.",
    "\u201cIt means, \u2018which is in danger of speedy disappearance.\u2019 \u201c   \u201cIs my flower in danger of speedy disappearance?\u201d   \u201cCertainly it is.\u201d   \u201cMy flower is ephemeral,\u201d the little prince said to himself, \u201cand she has only four thorns to  defend herself against the world.",
    "And I have left her on my planet, all alone!\u201d   That was his first moment of regret.",
    "But he took courage once more.",
    "\u201cWhat place would you  advise me to visit now?\u201d he asked.",
    "\u201cThe planet Earth,\u201d replied the geographer.",
    "\u201cIt has a good  reputation.\u201d And the little prince went away, thinking of his flower.",
    "So then the seventh planet was the Earth.",
    "The Earth is not just an ordinary planet!",
    "One can count, there 111 kings (not forgetting, to be sure, the Negro kings among them), 7000  geographers, 900,000 businessmen, 7,500,000 tipplers, 311,000,000 conceited men, that is to say,  about 2,000,000,000 grown-ups.",
    "To give you an idea of the size of the Earth, I will tell you that before the invention of electricity it  was necessary to maintain, over the whole of the six continents, a veritable army of 462,511  lamplighters for the street lamps.",
    "Seen from a slight distance, that would make a splendid  spectacle.",
    "The movements of this army would be regulated like those of the ballet in the opera.",
    "First would  come the turn of the lamplighters of New Zealand and Australia.",
    "Having set their lamps alight,  these would go off to sleep.",
    "Next, the lamplighters of China and Siberia would enter for their steps  in the dance, and then they too would be waved back into the wings.",
    "After that would come the  turn of the lamplighters of Russia and the Indies; then those of Africa and Europe, then those of  South America; then those of North America.",
    "And never would they make a mistake in the order  of their entry upon the stage.",
    "It would be magnificent.",
    "Only the man who was in charge of the single lamp at the North Pole, and his colleague who was  responsible for the single lamp at the South Pole, only these two would live free from toil and  care: they would be busy twice a year.",
    "When one wishes to play the wit, he sometimes wanders a little from the truth.",
    "I have not been altogether honest in what I have told you about the lamplighters.",
    "And I realise  that I run the risk of giving a false idea of our planet to those who do not know it.",
    "Men occupy a very small place upon the Earth.",
    "If the two billion inhabitants who people its  surface were all to stand upright and somewhat crowded together, as they do for some big public  assembly, they could easily be put into one public square twenty miles long and twenty miles wide.",
    "All humanity could be piled up on a small Pacific islet.",
    "The grown-ups, to be sure, will not believe you when you tell them that.",
    "They imagine that they fill  a great deal of space.",
    "They fancy themselves as important as the baobabs.",
    "You should advise  them, then, to make their own calculations.",
    "They adore figures, and that will please them.",
    "But do  not waste your time on this extra task.",
    "It is unnecessary.",
    "You have, I know, confidence in me.",
    "When the little prince arrived on the Earth, he was very much surprised not to see any people.",
    "He  was beginning to be afraid he had come to the wrong planet, when a coil of gold, the colour of the  moonlight, flashed across the sand.",
    "\u201cGood evening,\u201d said the little prince courteously.",
    "\u201cGood evening,\u201d said the snake.",
    "\u201cWhat planet is this on which I have come down?\u201d asked the little prince.",
    "\u201cThis is the Earth; this is Africa,\u201d the snake answered.",
    "\u201cAh!",
    "Then there are no people on the Earth?\u201d      \u201cThis is the desert.",
    "There are no people in the desert.",
    "The Earth is large,\u201d said the snake.",
    "The little prince sat down on a stone, and raised his eyes toward the sky.",
    "\u201cI wonder,\u201d he said, \u201cwhether the stars are set alight in heaven so that one day each one of us  may find his own again\u2026 Look at my planet.",
    "It is right there above us.",
    "But how far away it is!\u201d   \u201cIt is beautiful,\u201d the snake said.",
    "\u201cWhat has brought you here?\u201d   \u201cI have been having some trouble with a flower,\u201d said the little prince.",
    "\u201cAh!\u201d said the snake.",
    "And  they were both silent.",
    "\u201cWhere are the men?\u201d the little prince at last took up the conversation again.",
    "\u201cIt is a little lonely  in the desert\u2026\u201d   \u201cIt is also lonely among men,\u201d the snake said.",
    "The little prince gazed at him for a long time.",
    "\u201cYou are a funny animal,\u201d he said at last.",
    "\u201cYou are no thicker than a finger\u2026\u201d   \u201cBut I am more powerful than the finger of a king,\u201d said the snake.",
    "The little prince smiled.",
    "\u201cYou are not very powerful.",
    "You haven\u2019t even any feet.",
    "You cannot even  travel\u2026\u201d   \u201cI can carry you farther than any ship could take you,\u201d said the snake.",
    "He twined himself around  the little prince\u2019s ankle, like a golden bracelet.",
    "\u201cWhomever I touch, I send back to the earth from whence he came,\u201d the snake spoke again.",
    "\u201cBut  you are innocent and true, and you come from a star\u2026\u201d   The little prince made no reply.",
    "\u201cYou move me to pity, you are so weak on this Earth made of  granite,\u201d the snake said.",
    "\u201cI can help you, some day, if you grow too homesick for your own planet.",
    "I can\u2026\u201d   \u201cOh!",
    "I understand you very well,\u201d said the little prince.",
    "\u201cBut why do you always speak in  riddles?\u201d   \u201cI solve them all,\u201d said the snake.",
    "And they were both silent.",
    "The little prince crossed the desert and met with only one flower.",
    "It was a flower with three petals, a flower of no account at all.",
    "\u201cGood morning,\u201d said the little prince.",
    "\u201cGood morning,\u201d said the flower.",
    "\u201cWhere are the men?\u201d the little prince asked, politely.",
    "The flower had once seen a caravan  passing.",
    "\u201cMen?\u201d she echoed.",
    "\u201cI think there are six or seven of them in existence.",
    "I saw them, several  years ago.",
    "But one never knows where to find them.",
    "The wind blows them away.",
    "They have no  roots, and that makes their life very difficult.\u201d     \u201cGoodbye,\u201d said the little prince.",
    "\u201cGoodbye,\u201d said the flower.",
    "After that, the little prince climbed a high mountain.",
    "The only mountains he had ever known were  the three volcanoes, which came up to his knees.",
    "And he used the extinct volcano as a footstool.",
    "\u201cFrom a mountain as high as this one,\u201d he said to himself, \u201cI shall be able to see the whole planet  at one glance, and all the people\u2026\u201d But he saw nothing, save peaks of rock that were sharpened  like needles.",
    "\u201cGood morning,\u201d he said courteously.",
    "\u201cGood morning\u2026Good morning\u2026Good morning,\u201d answered the echo.",
    "\u201cWho are you?\u201d said the little prince.",
    "\u201cWho are you\u2026Who are you\u2026Who are you?\u201d answered the echo.",
    "\u201cBe my friends.",
    "I am all alone,\u201d he said.",
    "\u201cI am all alone\u2026all alone\u2026all alone,\u201d answered the echo.",
    "\u201cWhat a queer planet!\u201d he thought.",
    "\u201cIt is altogether dry, and altogether pointed, and altogether  harsh and forbidding.",
    "And the people have no imagination.",
    "They repeat whatever one says to  them\u2026 On my planet I had a flower; she always was the first to speak\u2026\u201d   But it happened that after walking for a long time through sand, and rocks, and snow, the little  prince at last came upon a road.",
    "And all roads lead to the abodes of men.",
    "\u201cGood morning,\u201d he said.",
    "He was standing before a garden, all a-bloom with roses.",
    "\u201cGood morning,\u201d said the roses.",
    "The little prince gazed at them.",
    "They all looked like his flower.",
    "\u201cWho are you?\u201d he demanded, thunderstruck.",
    "\u201cWe are roses,\u201d the roses said.",
    "And he was overcome with sadness.",
    "His flower had told him that  she was the only one of her kind in all the universe.",
    "And here were five thousand of them, all  alike, in one single garden!",
    "\u201cShe would be very much annoyed,\u201d he said to himself, \u201cif she should see that\u2026 she would cough     most dreadfully, and she would pretend that she was dying, to avoid being laughed at.",
    "And I  should be obliged to pretend that I was nursing her back to life, for if I did not do that, to humble  myself also, she would really allow herself to die\u2026\u201d   Then he went on with his reflections: \u201cI thought that I was rich, with a flower that was unique in all  the world; and all I had was a common rose.",
    "A common rose, and three volcanoes that come up to  my knees \u2014 and one of them perhaps extinct forever\u2026 that doesn\u2019t make me a very great  prince\u2026\u201d And he lay down in the grass and cried.",
    "It was then that the fox appeared.",
    "\u201cGood morning,\u201d said the fox.",
    "\u201cGood morning,\u201d the little prince responded politely, although when he turned around he saw  nothing.",
    "\u201cI am right here,\u201d the voice said, \u201cunder the apple tree.\u201d \u201c   Who are you?\u201d asked the little prince, and added, \u201cYou are very pretty to look at.\u201d   \u201cI am a fox,\u201d said the fox.",
    "\u201cCome and play with me,\u201d proposed the little prince.",
    "\u201cI am so unhappy.\u201d \u201cI cannot play with you,\u201d the fox said.",
    "\u201cI am not tamed.\u201d   \u201cAh!",
    "Please excuse me,\u201d said the little prince.",
    "But, after some thought, he added: \u201cWhat does  that mean, \u2018tame\u2019?\u201d      \u201cYou do not live here,\u201d said the fox.",
    "\u201cWhat is it that you are looking for?\u201d   \u201cI am looking for men,\u201d said the little prince.",
    "\u201cWhat does that mean, \u2018tame\u2019?\u201d   \u201cMen,\u201d said the fox.",
    "\u201cThey have guns, and they hunt.",
    "It is very disturbing.",
    "They also raise  chickens.",
    "These are their only interests.",
    "Are you looking for chickens?\u201d   \u201cNo,\u201d said the little prince.",
    "\u201cI am looking for friends.",
    "What does that mean, \u2018tame\u2019?\u201d   \u201cIt is an act too often neglected,\u201d said the fox.",
    "It means to establish ties.\u201d     \u201c\u2018To establish ties\u2019?\u201d     \u201cJust that,\u201d said the fox.",
    "\u201cTo me, you are still nothing more than a little boy who is just like a  hundred thousand other little boys.",
    "And I have no need of you.",
    "And you, on your part, have no  need of me.",
    "To you, I am nothing more than a fox like a hundred thousand other foxes.",
    "But if you  tame me, then we shall need each other.",
    "To me, you will be unique in all the world.",
    "To you, I shall  be unique in all the world\u2026\u201d   \u201cI am beginning to understand,\u201d said the little prince.",
    "\u201cThere is a flower\u2026 I think that she has  tamed me\u2026\u201d   \u201cIt is possible,\u201d said the fox.",
    "\u201cOn the Earth one sees all sorts of things.\u201d   \u201cOh, but this is not on the Earth!\u201d said the little prince.",
    "The fox seemed perplexed, and very  curious.",
    "\u201cOn another planet?\u201d   \u201cYes.\u201d   \u201cAre there hunters on this planet?\u201d   \u201cNo.\u201d   \u201cAh, that is interesting!",
    "Are there chickens?\u201d   \u201cNo.\u201d   \u201cNothing is perfect,\u201d sighed the fox.",
    "But he came back to his idea.",
    "\u201cMy life is very monotonous,\u201d  the fox said.",
    "\u201cI hunt chickens; men hunt me.",
    "All the chickens are just alike, and all the men are  just alike.",
    "And, in consequence, I am a little bored.",
    "But if you tame me, it will be as if the sun  came to shine on my life.",
    "I shall know the sound of a step that will be different from all the others.",
    "Other steps send me hurrying back underneath the ground.",
    "Yours will call me, like music, out of  my burrow.",
    "And then look: you see the grain-fields down yonder?",
    "I do not eat bread.",
    "Wheat is of  no use to me.",
    "The wheat fields have nothing to say to me.",
    "And that is sad.",
    "But you have hair that  is the colour of gold.",
    "Think how wonderful that will be when you have tamed me!",
    "The grain, which  is also golden, will bring me back the thought of you.",
    "And I shall love to listen to the wind in the  wheat\u2026\u201d The fox gazed at the little prince, for a long time.",
    "\u201cPlease, tame me!\u201d he said.",
    "\u201cI want to, very much,\u201d the little prince replied.",
    "\u201cBut I have not much time.",
    "I have friends to  discover, and a great many things to understand.\u201d   \u201cOne only understands the things that one tames,\u201d said the fox.",
    "\u201cMen have no more time to  understand anything.",
    "They buy things all ready-made at the shops.",
    "But there is no shop anywhere  where one can buy friendship, and so men have no friends any more.",
    "If you want a friend, tame  me\u2026\u201d   \u201cWhat must I do, to tame you?\u201d asked the little prince.",
    "\u201cYou must be very patient,\u201d replied the fox.",
    "\u201cFirst you will sit down at a little distance from me,  like that, in the grass.",
    "I shall look at you out of the corner of my eye, and you will say nothing.",
    "Words are the source of misunderstandings.",
    "But you will sit a little closer to me, every day\u2026\u201d      The next day the little prince came back.",
    "\u201cIt would have been better to come back at the same hour,\u201d said the fox.",
    "\u201cIf, for example, you  come at four o\u2019clock in the afternoon, then at three o\u2019clock I shall begin to be happy.",
    "I shall feel  happier and happier as the hour advances.",
    "At four o\u2019clock, I shall already be worrying and  jumping about.",
    "I shall show you how happy I am!",
    "But if you come at just any time, I shall never  know at what hour my heart is to be ready to greet you\u2026 One must observe the proper rites\u2026\u201d   \u201cWhat is a rite?\u201d asked the little prince.",
    "\u201cThose also are actions too often neglected,\u201d said the fox.",
    "\u201cThey are what make one day  different from other days, one hour from other hours.",
    "There is a rite, for example, among my  hunters.",
    "Every Thursday they dance with the village girls.",
    "So Thursday is a wonderful day for me!",
    "I can take a walk as far as the vineyards.",
    "But if the hunters danced at just any time, every day  would be like every other day, and I should never have any vacation at all.\u201d   So the little prince tamed the fox.",
    "And when the hour of his departure drew near\u2026   \u201cAh,\u201d said the fox, \u201cI shall cry.\u201d   \u201cIt is your own fault,\u201d said the little prince.",
    "\u201cI never wished you any sort of harm; but you wanted  me to tame you\u2026\u201d   \u201cYes, that is so,\u201d said the fox.",
    "\u201cBut now you are going to cry!\u201d said the little prince.",
    "\u201cYes, that is so,\u201d said the fox.",
    "\u201cThen it has done you no good at all!\u201d   \u201cIt has done me good,\u201d said the fox, \u201cbecause of the colour of the wheat fields.\u201d And then he  added: \u201cGo and look again at the roses.",
    "You will understand now that yours is unique in all the  world.",
    "Then come back to say goodbye to me, and I will make you a present of a secret.\u201d   The little prince went away, to look again at the roses.",
    "\u201cYou are not at all like my rose,\u201d he said.",
    "\u201cAs yet you are nothing.",
    "No one has tamed you, and you have tamed no one.",
    "You are like my fox  when I first knew him.",
    "He was only a fox like a hundred thousand other foxes.",
    "But I have made  him my friend, and now he is unique in all the world.\u201d And the roses were very much embarrassed.",
    "\u201cYou are beautiful, but you are empty,\u201d he went on.",
    "\u201cOne could not die for you.",
    "To be sure, an  ordinary passer-by would think that my rose looked just like you, the rose that belongs to me.",
    "But  in herself alone she is more important than all the hundreds of you other roses: because it is she  that I have watered; because it is she that I have put under the glass globe; because it is she that  I have sheltered behind the screen; because it is for her that I have killed the caterpillars (except  the two or three that we saved to become butterflies); because it is she that I have listened to,  when she grumbled, or boasted, or even sometimes when she said nothing.",
    "Because she is my  rose.",
    "And he went back to meet the fox.",
    "\u201cGoodbye,\u201d he said.",
    "\u201cGoodbye,\u201d said the fox.",
    "\u201cAnd now here is my secret, a very simple secret: It is only with the  heart that one can see rightly; what is essential is invisible to the eye.\u201d      \u201cWhat is essential is invisible to the eye,\u201d the little prince repeated, so that he would be sure to  remember.",
    "\u201cIt is the time you have wasted for your rose that makes your rose so important.\u201d   \u201cIt is the time I have wasted for my rose\u2026\u201d said the little prince, so that he would be sure to  remember.",
    "\u201cMen have forgotten this truth,\u201d said the fox.",
    "\u201cBut you must not forget it.",
    "You become  responsible, forever, for what you have tamed.",
    "You are responsible for your rose\u2026\u201d   \u201cI am responsible for my rose,\u201d the little prince repeated, so that he would be sure to remember.",
    "\u201cGood morning,\u201d said the little prince.",
    "\u201cGood morning,\u201d said the railway switchman.",
    "\u201cWhat do you do here?\u201d the little prince asked.",
    "\u201cI sort out travellers, in bundles of a thousand,\u201d said the switchman.",
    "\u201cI send off the trains that  carry them; now to the right, now to the left.\u201d And a brilliantly lighted express train shook the  switchman\u2019s cabin as it rushed by with a roar like thunder.",
    "\u201cThey are in a great hurry,\u201d said the little prince.",
    "\u201cWhat are they looking for?\u201d   \u201cNot even the locomotive engineer knows that,\u201d said the switchman.",
    "And a second brilliantly  lighted express thundered by, in the opposite direction.",
    "\u201cAre they coming back already?\u201d demanded the little prince.",
    "\u201cThese are not the same ones,\u201d said  the switchman.",
    "\u201cIt is an exchange.\u201d   \u201cWere they not satisfied where they were?\u201d asked the little prince.",
    "\u201cNo one is ever satisfied where he is,\u201d said the switchman.",
    "And they heard the roaring thunder of  a third brilliantly lighted express.",
    "\u201cAre they pursuing the first travellers?\u201d demanded the little prince.",
    "\u201cThey are pursuing nothing at all,\u201d said the switchman.",
    "\u201cThey are asleep in there, or if they are  not asleep they are yawning.",
    "Only the children are flattening their noses against the  windowpanes.\u201d   \u201cOnly the children know what they are looking for,\u201d said the little prince.",
    "\u201cThey waste their time over a rag doll and it becomes very important to them; and if anybody  takes it away from them, they cry\u2026\u201d \u201cThey are lucky,\u201d the switchman said.",
    "\u201cGood morning,\u201d said the little prince.",
    "\u201cGood morning,\u201d said the merchant.",
    "This was a merchant who sold pills that had been invented to quench thirst.",
    "You need only swallow  one pill a week, and you would feel no need of anything to drink.",
    "\u201cWhy are you selling those?\u201d asked the little prince.",
    "\u201cBecause they save a tremendous amount of time,\u201d said the merchant.",
    "\u201cComputations have been  made by experts.",
    "With these pills, you save fifty-three minutes in every week.\u201d   \u201cAnd what do I do with those fifty-three minutes?\u201d   \u201cAnything you like\u2026\u201d   \u201cAs for me,\u201d said the little prince to himself, \u201cif I had fifty-three minutes to spend as I liked, I  should walk at my leisure toward a spring of fresh water.\u201d   It was now the eighth day since I had had my accident in the desert, and I had listened to the story  of the merchant as I was drinking the last drop of my water supply.",
    "\u201cAh,\u201d I said to the little prince, \u201cthese memories of yours are very charming; but I have not yet  succeeded in repairing my plane; I have nothing more to drink; and I, too, should be very happy if  I could walk at my leisure toward a spring of fresh water!\u201d   \u201cMy friend the fox\u2026\u201d the little prince said to me.",
    "\u201cMy dear little man, this is no longer a matter that has anything to do with the fox!\u201d   \u201cWhy not?\u201d   \u201cBecause I am about to die of thirst\u2026\u201d   He did not follow my reasoning, and he answered me: \u201cIt is a good thing to have had a friend,  even if one is about to die.",
    "I, for instance, am very glad to have had a fox as a friend\u2026\u201d   \u201cHe has no way of guessing the danger,\u201d I said to myself.",
    "\u201cHe has never been either hungry or  thirsty.",
    "A little sunshine is all he needs\u2026\u201d   But he looked at me steadily, and replied to my thought: \u201cI am thirsty, too.",
    "Let us look for a  well\u2026\u201d I made a gesture of weariness.",
    "It is absurd to look for a well, at random, in the immensity  of the desert.",
    "But nevertheless we started walking.",
    "When we had trudged along for several hours, in silence, the darkness fell, and the stars began to  come out.",
    "Thirst had made me a little feverish, and I looked at them as if I were in a dream.",
    "The  little prince\u2019s last words came reeling back into my memory: \u201cThen you are thirsty, too?\u201d I  demanded.",
    "But he did not reply to my question.",
    "He merely said to me: \u201cWater may also be good  for the heart\u2026\u201d   I did not understand this answer, but I said nothing.",
    "I knew very well that it was impossible to  cross-examine him.",
    "He was tired.",
    "He sat down.",
    "I sat down beside him.",
    "And, after a little silence,  he spoke again: \u201cThe stars are beautiful, because of a flower that cannot be seen.\u201d   I replied, \u201cYes, that is so.\u201d And, without saying anything more, I looked across the ridges of sand  that were stretched out before us in the moonlight.",
    "\u201cThe desert is beautiful,\u201d the little prince added.",
    "And that was true.",
    "I have always loved the desert.",
    "One sits down on a desert sand dune, sees       nothing, hears nothing.",
    "Yet through the silence something throbs, and gleams\u2026   \u201cWhat makes the desert beautiful,\u201d said the little prince, \u201cis that somewhere it hides a well\u2026\u201d   I was astonished by a sudden understanding of that mysterious radiation of the sands.",
    "When I was  a little boy I lived in an old house, and legend told us that a treasure was buried there.",
    "To be sure,  no one had ever known how to find it; perhaps no one had ever even looked for it.",
    "But it cast an  enchantment over that house.",
    "My home was hiding a secret in the depths of its heart\u2026 \u201cYes,\u201d I  said to the little prince.",
    "\u201cThe house, the stars, the desert \u2014 what gives them their beauty is  something that is invisible!\u201d   \u201cI am glad,\u201d he said, \u201cthat you agree with my fox.\u201d As the little prince dropped off to sleep, I took  him in my arms and set out walking once more.",
    "I felt deeply moved, and stirred.",
    "It seemed to me  that I was carrying a very fragile treasure.",
    "It seemed to me, even, that there was nothing more  fragile on all Earth.",
    "In the moonlight I looked at his pale forehead, his closed eyes, his locks of  hair that trembled in the wind, and I said to myself:   \u201cWhat I see here is nothing but a shell.",
    "What is most important is invisible\u2026\u201d   As his lips opened slightly with the suspicious of a half-smile, I said to myself, again: \u201cWhat  moves me so deeply, about this little prince who is sleeping here, is his loyalty to a flower \u2014 the  image of a rose that shines through his whole being like the flame of a lamp, even when he is  asleep\u2026\u201d   And I felt him to be more fragile still.",
    "I felt the need of protecting him, as if he himself were a  flame that might be extinguished by a little puff of wind\u2026 And, as I walked on so, I found the well,  at daybreak.",
    "\u201cMen,\u201d said the little prince, \u201cset out on their way in express trains, but they do not know what  they are looking for.",
    "Then they rush about, and get excited, and turn round and round\u2026\u201d And he  added: \u201cIt is not worth the trouble\u2026\u201d     The well that we had come to was not like the wells of the Sahara.",
    "The wells of the Sahara are  mere holes dug in the sand.",
    "This one was like a well in a village.",
    "But there was no village here,  and I thought I must be dreaming\u2026   \u201cIt is strange,\u201d I said to the little prince.",
    "\u201cEverything is ready for use: the pulley, the bucket, the  rope\u2026\u201d He laughed, touched the rope, and set the pulley to working.",
    "And the pulley moaned, like  an old weathervane, which the wind has long since forgotten.",
    "\u201cDo you hear?\u201d said the little prince.",
    "\u201cWe have wakened the well, and it is singing\u2026\u201d   I did not want him to tire himself with the rope.",
    "\u201cLeave it to me,\u201d I said.",
    "\u201cIt is too heavy for you.\u201d I hoisted the bucket slowly to the edge of the  well and set it there, happy, tired as I was, over my achievement.",
    "The song of the pulley was still  in my ears, and I could see the sunlight shimmer in the still trembling water.",
    "\u201cI am thirsty for this water,\u201d said the little prince.",
    "\u201cGive me some of it to drink\u2026\u201d   And I understood what he had been looking for.",
    "I raised the bucket to his lips.",
    "He drank, his eyes  closed.",
    "It was as sweet as some special festival treat.",
    "This water was indeed a different thing from  ordinary nourishment.",
    "Its sweetness was born of the walk under the stars, the song of the pulley,  the effort of my arms.",
    "It was good for the heart, like a present.",
    "When I was a little boy, the lights  of the Christmas tree, the music of the Midnight Mass, the tenderness of smiling faces, used to  make up, so, the radiance of the gifts I received.",
    "\u201cThe men where you live,\u201d said the little prince, \u201craise five thousand roses in the same garden  and they do not find in it what they are looking for.\u201d   \u201cThey do not find it,\u201d I replied.",
    "\u201cAnd yet what they are looking for could be found in one single rose, or in a little water.\u201d   \u201cYes, that is true,\u201d I said.",
    "And the little prince added: \u201cBut the eyes are blind.",
    "One must look with the heart\u2026\u201d   I had drunk the water.",
    "I breathed easily.",
    "At sunrise the sand is the colour of honey.",
    "And that  honey colour was making me happy, too.",
    "What brought me, then, this sense of grief?",
    "\u201cYou must keep your promise,\u201d said the little prince, softly, as he sat down beside me once more.",
    "\u201cWhat promise?\u201d \u201cYou know, a muzzle for my sheep\u2026 I am responsible for this flower\u2026\u201d   I took my rough drafts of drawings out of my pocket.",
    "The little prince looked them over, and  laughed as he said:   \u201cYour baobabs, they look a little like cabbages.\u201d   \u201cOh!\u201d I had been so proud of my baobabs!",
    "\u201cYour fox, his ears look a little like horns; and they are  too long.\u201d And he laughed again.",
    "\u201cYou are not fair, little prince,\u201d I said.",
    "\u201cI don\u2019t know how to draw anything except boa constrictors  from the outside and boa constrictors from the inside.\u201d       \u201cOh, that will be all right,\u201d he said, \u201cchildren understand.\u201d   So then I made a pencil sketch of a muzzle.",
    "And as I gave it to him my heart was torn.",
    "\u201cYou have plans that I do not know about,\u201d I said.",
    "But he did not answer me.",
    "He said to me,  instead: \u201cYou know, my descent to the earth\u2026 Tomorrow will be its anniversary.\u201d Then, after a  silence, he went on: \u201cI came down very near here.\u201d And he flushed.",
    "And once again, without understanding why, I had a queer sense of sorrow.",
    "One question,  however, occurred to me: \u201cThen it was not by chance that on the morning when I first met you \u2014 a  week ago \u2014 you were strolling along like that, all alone, a thousand miles from any inhabited  region?",
    "You were on the your way back to the place where you landed?\u201d   The little prince flushed again.",
    "And I added, with some hesitancy: \u201cPerhaps it was because of the  anniversary?\u201d The little prince flushed once more.",
    "He never answered questions, but when one  flushes does that not mean \u201cYes\u201d?",
    "\u201cAh,\u201d I said to him, \u201cI am a little frightened\u2026\u201d   But he interrupted me.",
    "\u201cNow you must work.",
    "You must return to your engine.",
    "I will be waiting for  you here.",
    "Come back tomorrow evening\u2026\u201d   But I was not reassured.",
    "I remembered the fox.",
    "One runs the risk of weeping a little, if one lets  himself be tamed\u2026   Beside the well there was the ruin of an old stone wall.",
    "When I came back from my work, the next  evening, I saw from some distance away my little prince sitting on top of a wall, with his feet  dangling.",
    "And I heard him say: \u201cThen you don\u2019t remember.",
    "This is not the exact spot.\u201d Another  voice must have answered him, for he replied to it: \u201cYes, yes!",
    "It is the right day, but this is not the  place.\u201d   I continued my walk toward the wall.",
    "At no time did I see or hear anyone.",
    "The little prince,  however, replied once again: \u201c\u2026Exactly.",
    "You will see where my track begins, in the sand.",
    "You have  nothing to do but wait for me there.",
    "I shall be there tonight.\u201d     I was only twenty metres from the wall, and I still saw nothing.",
    "After a silence the little prince  spoke again: \u201cYou have good poison?",
    "You are sure that it will not make me suffer too long?\u201d I  stopped in my tracks, my heart torn asunder; but still I did not understand.",
    "\u201cNow go away,\u201d said  the little prince.",
    "\u201cI want to get down from the wall.\u201d   I dropped my eyes, then, to the foot of the wall\u2026 and I leaped into the air.",
    "There before me, facing  the little prince, was one of those yellow snakes that take just thirty seconds to bring your life to  an end.",
    "Even as I was digging into my pocked to get out my revolver I made a running step back.",
    "But, at the noise I made, the snake let himself flow easily across the sand like the dying spray of  a fountain, and, in no apparent hurry, disappeared, with a light metallic sound, among the stones.",
    "I  reached the wall just in time to catch my little man in my arms; his face was white as snow.",
    "\u201cWhat does this mean?\u201d I demanded.",
    "\u201cWhy are you talking with snakes?\u201d   I had loosened the golden muffler that he always wore.",
    "I had moistened his temples, and had  given him some water to drink.",
    "And now I did not dare ask him any more questions.",
    "He looked at  me very gravely, and put his arms around my neck.",
    "I felt his heart beating like the heart of a  dying bird, shot with someone\u2019s rifle\u2026   \u201cI am glad that you have found what was the matter with your engine,\u201d he said.",
    "\u201cNow you can go  back home\u201d   \u201cHow do you know about that?\u201d I was just coming to tell him that my work had been successful,  beyond anything that I had dared to hope.",
    "He made no answer to my question, but he added: \u201cI, too, am going back home today\u2026\u201d Then,  sadly, \u201cIt is much farther\u2026 it is much more difficult\u2026\u201d I realised clearly that something  extraordinary was happening.",
    "I was holding him close in my arms as if he were a little child; and  yet it seemed to me that he was rushing headlong toward an abyss from which I could do nothing  to restrain him\u2026 His look was very serious, like some one lost far away.",
    "\u201cI have your sheep.",
    "And I have the sheep\u2019s box.",
    "And I have the muzzle\u2026\u201d   And he gave me a sad smile.",
    "I waited a long time.",
    "I could see that he was reviving little by little.",
    "\u201cDear little man,\u201d I said to him, \u201cyou are afraid\u2026\u201d He was afraid, there was no doubt about that.",
    "But he laughed lightly.",
    "\u201cI shall be much more afraid this evening\u2026\u201d   Once again I felt myself frozen by the sense of something irreparable.",
    "And I knew that I could not  bear the thought of never hearing that laughter any more.",
    "For me, it was like a spring of fresh  water in the desert.",
    "\u201cLittle man,\u201d I said, \u201cI want to hear you laugh again.\u201d But he said to me: \u201cTonight, it will be a  year\u2026 my star, then, can be found right above the place where I came to the Earth, a year ago\u2026\u201d   \u201cLittle man,\u201d I said, \u201ctell me that it is only a bad dream, this affair of the snake, and the meeting-  place, and the star\u2026\u201d But he did not answer my plea.",
    "He said to me, instead: \u201cThe thing that is important is the thing that is not seen\u2026\u201d \u201cYes, I  know\u2026\u201d      \u201cIt is just as it is with the flower.",
    "If you love a flower that lives on a star, it is sweet to look at the  sky at night.",
    "All the stars are a-bloom with flowers\u2026\u201d   \u201cYes, I know\u2026\u201d   \u201cIt is just as it is with the water.",
    "Because of the pulley, and the rope, what you gave me to drink  was like music.",
    "You remember, how good it was.\u201d   \u201cYes, I know\u2026\u201d   \u201cAnd at night you will look up at the stars.",
    "Where I live everything is so small that I cannot show  you where my star is to be found.",
    "It is better, like that.",
    "My star will just be one of the stars, for  you.",
    "And so you will love to watch all the stars in the heavens\u2026 they will all be your friends.",
    "And,  besides, I am going to make you a present\u2026\u201d He laughed again.",
    "\u201cAh, little prince, dear little prince!",
    "I love to hear that laughter!\u201d   \u201cThat is my present.",
    "Just that.",
    "It will be as it was when we drank the water\u2026\u201d   \u201cWhat are you trying to say?\u201d   \u201cAll men have the stars,\u201d he answered, \u201cbut they are not the same things for different people.",
    "For  some, who are travellers, the stars are guides.",
    "For others they are no more than little lights in the  sky.",
    "For others, who are scholars, they are problems.",
    "For my businessman they were wealth.",
    "But  all these stars are silent.",
    "You, you alone, will have the stars as no one else has them\u201d   \u201cWhat are you trying to say?\u201d   \u201cIn one of the stars I shall be living.",
    "In one of them I shall be laughing.",
    "And so it will be as if all  the stars were laughing, when you look at the sky at night\u2026 you, only you, will have stars that can  laugh!\u201d   And he laughed again.",
    "\u201cAnd when your sorrow is comforted (time soothes all sorrows) you will be  content that you have known me.",
    "You will always be my friend.",
    "You will want to laugh with me.",
    "And  you will sometimes open your window, so, for that pleasure\u2026 and your friends will be properly  astonished to see you laughing as you look up at the sky!",
    "Then you will say to them, \u2018Yes, the  stars always make me laugh!\u2019 And they will think you are crazy.",
    "It will be a very shabby trick that  I shall have played on you\u2026\u201d   And he laughed again.",
    "\u201cIt will be as if, in place of the stars, I had given you a great number of  little bells that knew how to laugh\u2026\u201d   And he laughed again.",
    "Then he quickly became serious: \u201cTonight, you know\u2026 do not come,\u201d said  the little prince.",
    "\u201cI shall not leave you,\u201d I said.",
    "\u201cI shall look as if I were suffering.",
    "I shall look a little as if I were dying.",
    "It is like that.",
    "Do not  come to see that.",
    "It is not worth the trouble\u2026\u201d   \u201cI shall not leave you.\u201d     But he was worried.",
    "\u201cI tell you, it is also because of the snake.",
    "He must not bite you.",
    "Snakes, they      are malicious creatures.",
    "This one might bite you just for fun\u2026\u201d     \u201cI shall not leave you.\u201d   But a thought came to reassure him: \u201cIt is true that they have no more poison for a second bite.\u201d   That night I did not see him set out on his way.",
    "He got away from me without making a sound.",
    "When I succeeded in catching up with him he was walking along with a quick and resolute step.",
    "He  said to me merely: \u201cAh!",
    "You are there\u2026\u201d And he took me by the hand.",
    "But he was still worrying.",
    "\u201cIt was wrong of you to come.",
    "You will suffer.",
    "I shall look as if I were dead; and that will not be  true\u2026\u201d   I said nothing.",
    "\u201cYou understand\u2026 it is too far.",
    "I cannot carry this body with me.",
    "It is too heavy.\u201d   I said nothing.",
    "\u201cBut it will be like an old abandoned shell.",
    "There is nothing sad about old shells\u2026\u201d   I said nothing.",
    "He was a little discouraged.",
    "But he made one more effort: \u201cYou know, it will be  very nice.",
    "I, too, shall look at the stars.",
    "All the stars will be wells with a rusty pulley.",
    "All the stars  will pour out fresh water for me to drink\u2026\u201d   I said nothing.",
    "\u201cThat will be so amusing!",
    "You will have five hundred million little bells, and I shall have five  hundred million springs of fresh water\u2026\u201d And he too said nothing more, because he was crying\u2026   \u201cHere it is.",
    "Let me go on by myself.\u201d And he sat down, because he was afraid.",
    "Then he said,  again: \u201cYou know, my flower\u2026 I am responsible for her.",
    "And she is so weak!",
    "She has four thorns,  of no use at all, to protect herself against all the world\u2026\u201d   I too sat down, because I was not able to stand up any longer.",
    "\u201cThere now, that is all\u2026\u201d   He still hesitated a little; then he got up.",
    "He took one step.",
    "I could not move.",
    "There was nothing  but a flash of yellow close to his ankle.",
    "He remained motionless for an instant.",
    "He did not cry out.",
    "He fell as gently as a tree falls.",
    "There was not even any sound, because of the sand.",
    "And now six years have already gone by\u2026 I have never yet told this story.",
    "The companions who met me on my return were well content to see me alive.",
    "I was sad, but I told  them: \u201cI am tired.\u201d Now my sorrow is comforted a little.",
    "That is to say, not entirely.",
    "But I know  that he did go back to his planet, because I did not find his body at daybreak.",
    "It was not such a  heavy body\u2026 and at night I love to listen to the stars.",
    "It is like five hundred million little bells\u2026  But there is one extraordinary thing\u2026 when I drew the muzzle for the little prince, I forgot to add  the leather strap to it.",
    "He will never have been able to fasten it on his sheep.",
    "So now I keep wondering: what is happening on his planet?",
    "Perhaps the sheep has eaten the  flower\u2026 At one time I say to myself: \u201cSurely not!",
    "The little prince shuts his flower under her glass  globe every night, and he watches over his sheep very carefully\u2026\u201d Then I am happy.",
    "And there is  sweetness in the laughter of all the stars.",
    "But at another time I say to myself: \u201cAt some moment or other one is absent-minded, and that is  enough!",
    "On some one evening he forgot the glass globe, or the sheep got out, without making any  noise, in the night\u2026\u201d And then the little bells are changed to tears\u2026 Here, then, is a great  mystery.",
    "For you who also love the little prince, and for me, nothing in the universe can be the same if  somewhere, we do not know where, a sheep that we never saw has eaten a rose\u2026 Look up at the  sky.",
    "Ask yourselves: is it yes or no?",
    "Has the sheep eaten the flower?",
    "And you will see how everything changes\u2026 And no grown-up will  ever understand that this is a matter of so much importance!",
    "This is, to me, the loveliest and  saddest landscape in the world.",
    "It is the same as that on the preceding page, but I have drawn it  again to impress it on your memory.",
    "It is here that the little prince appeared on Earth, and  disappeared.",
    "Look at it carefully so that you will be sure to recognise it in case you travel some  day to the African desert.",
    "And, if you should come upon this spot, please do not hurry on.",
    "Wait for  a time, exactly under the star.",
    "Then, if a little man appears who laughs, who has golden hair and  who refuses to answer questions, you will know who he is.",
    "If this should happen, please comfort  me.",
    "Send me word that he has come back.",
    ""
