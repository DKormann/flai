    "Once when I was six years old I saw a magnificent picture in a book, called True Stories from \nNature, about the primeval forest.\n",
    "It was a picture of a boa constrictor in the act of swallowing an \nanimal.\nHere is a copy of the drawing.\n",
    "\nIn the book it said: \u201cBoa constrictors swallow their prey whole, without chewing it.\nAfter that they \n",
    "are not able to move, and they sleep through the six months that they need for digestion.\u201d I \npondered deeply, then, over the adventures of the jungle.\n",
    "And after some work with a coloured \npencil I succeeded in making my first drawing.\nMy Drawing Number One.\n",
    "It looked like this: \n\n\nI showed my masterpiece to the grown-ups, and asked them whether the drawing frightened them.\n",
    "But they answered: \u201cFrighten?\nWhy should any one be frightened by a hat?\u201d My drawing was not \na picture of a hat.\n",
    "It was a picture of a boa constrictor digesting an elephant.\nBut since the grown- \nups were not able to understand it, I made another drawing: I drew the inside of the boa \n",
    "constrictor, so that the grown-ups could see it clearly.\nThey always need to have things explained.\n",
    "\n\nMy Drawing Number Two looked like this: \n\n\nThe grown-ups\u2019 response, this time, was to advise me to lay aside my drawings of boa \n",
    "constrictors, whether from the inside or the outside, and devote myself instead to geography, \nhistory, arithmetic and grammar.\n",
    "That is why, at the age of six, I gave up what might have been a \nmagnificent career as a painter.\nI had been disheartened by the failure of my Drawing Number \n",
    "One and my Drawing Number Two.\nGrown-ups never understand anything by themselves, and it is \ntiresome for children to be always and forever explaining things to them.\n",
    "\nSo then I chose another profession, and learned to pilot air-planes.\nI have flown a little over all \n",
    "parts of the world; and it is true that geography has been very useful to me.\nAt a glance I can \ndistinguish China from Arizona.\n",
    "If one gets lost in the night, such knowledge is valuable.\nIn the \ncourse of this life I have had a great many encounters with a great many people who have been \n",
    "concerned with matters of consequence.\nI have lived a great deal among grown-ups.\nI have seen \nthem intimately, close at hand.\n",
    "And that hasn\u2019t much improved my opinion of them.\n\nWhenever I met one of them who seemed to me at all clear-sighted, I tried the experiment of \n",
    "showing him my Drawing Number One, which I have always kept.\nI would try to find out, so, if this \nwas a person of true understanding.\n",
    "But, whoever it was, he, or she, would always say: \u201cThat is a \nhat.\u201d Then I would never talk to that person about boa constrictors, or primeval forests, or stars.\n",
    "I \nwould bring myself down to his level.\nI would talk to him about bridge, and golf, and politics, and \n",
    "neckties.\nAnd the grown-up would be greatly pleased to have met such a sensible man.\n\nSo I lived my life alone, without anyone that I could really talk to, until I had an accident with my \n",
    "plane in the Desert of Sahara, six years ago.\nSomething was broken in my engine.\nAnd as I had \nwith me neither a mechanic nor any passengers, I set myself to attempt the difficult repairs all \n",
    "alone.\nIt was a question of life or death for me: I had scarcely enough drinking water to last a \nweek.\n",
    "\nThe first night, then, I went to sleep on the sand, a thousand miles from any human habitation.\nI \n",
    "was more isolated than a shipwrecked sailor on a raft in the middle of the ocean.\nThus you can \nimagine my amazement, at sunrise, when I was awakened by an odd little voice.\n",
    "\n\nIt said: \u201cIf you please, draw me a sheep!\u201d \n\u201cWhat!\u201d \n\u201cDraw me a sheep!\u201d \nI jumped to my feet, completely thunderstruck.\n",
    "I blinked my eyes hard.\nI looked carefully all \naround me.\nAnd I saw a most extraordinary small person, who stood there examining me with \n",
    "great seriousness.\nHere you may see the best portrait that, later, I was able to make of him.\nBut \nmy drawing is certainly very much less charming than its model.\n",
    "\nThat, however, is not my fault.\nThe grown-ups discouraged me in my painter\u2019s career when I was \nsix years old, and I never learned to draw anything, except boas from the outside and boas from \n",
    "the inside.\n\nNow I stared at this sudden apparition with my eyes fairly starting out of my head in \n",
    "astonishment.\nRemember, I had crashed in the desert a thousand miles from any inhabited region.\nAnd yet my little man seemed neither to be straying uncertainly among the sands, nor to be \n",
    "fainting from fatigue or hunger or thirst or fear.\nNothing about him gave any suggestion of a child \n",
    "lost in the middle of the desert, a thousand miles from any human habitation.\n\nWhen at last I was able to speak, I said to him: \u201cBut, what are you doing here?\u201d And in answer he \n",
    "repeated, very slowly, as if he were speaking of a matter of great consequence: \n\u201cIf you please, draw me a sheep\u2026\u201d \n",
    "When a mystery is too overpowering, one dare not disobey.\nAbsurd as it might seem to me, a \nthousand miles from any human habitation and in danger of death, I took out of my pocket a sheet \n",
    "of paper and my fountain pen.\nBut then I remembered how my studies had been concentrated on \ngeography, history, arithmetic, and grammar, and I told the little chap (a little crossly, too) that I \n",
    "did not know how to draw.\nHe answered me: \u201cThat doesn\u2019t matter.\nDraw me a sheep\u2026\u201d \n\n\nBut I had never drawn a sheep.\n",
    "So I drew for him one of the two pictures I had drawn so often.\nIt \nwas that of the boa constrictor from the outside.\n",
    "And I was astounded to hear the little fellow \ngreet it with, \u201cNo, no, no!\nI do not want an elephant inside a boa constrictor.\n",
    "A boa constrictor is a \nvery dangerous creature, and an elephant is very cumbersome.\nWhere I live, everything is very \n",
    "small.\nWhat I need is a sheep.\nDraw me a sheep.\n\n\nSo then I made a drawing.\nHe looked at it carefully, then he said: \u201cNo.\n",
    "This sheep is already very \nsickly.\nMake me another.\u201d So I made another drawing.\nMy friend smiled gently and indulgently.\n",
    "\u201cYou see yourself,\u201d he said, \u201cthat this is not a sheep.\nThis is a ram.\nIt has horns.\n\n\nSo then I did my drawing over once more.\n",
    "But it was rejected too, just like the others.\n\u201cThis one is \ntoo old.\nI want a sheep that will live a long time.\n",
    "\nBy this time my patience was exhausted, because I was in a hurry to start taking my engine apart.\nSo I tossed off this drawing.\n",
    "And I threw out an explanation with it.\n\n\u201cThis is only his box.\nThe sheep you asked for is inside.\u201d \n",
    "\n\nI was very surprised to see a light break over the face of my young judge: \n\u201cThat is exactly the way I wanted it!\n",
    "Do you think that this sheep will have to have a great deal of \ngrass?\u201d \n\u201cWhy?\u201d \n\u201cBecause where I live everything is very small\u2026\u201d \n",
    "\u201cThere will surely be enough grass for him,\u201d I said.\n\n\u201cIt is a very small sheep that I have given you.\u201d \n",
    "He bent his head over the drawing: \u201cNot so small that, Look!\nHe has gone to sleep\u2026\u201d \nAnd that is how I made the acquaintance of the little prince.\n",
    "\nIt took me a long time to learn where he came from.\nThe little prince, who asked me so many \nquestions, never seemed to hear the ones I asked him.\n",
    "It was from words dropped by chance that, \nlittle by little, everything was revealed to me.\n\nThe first time he saw my air-plane, for instance (I shall not draw my air-plane; that would be much \n",
    "too complicated for me), he asked me: \u201cWhat is that object?\u201d \n\u201cThat is not an object.\nIt flies.\nIt is an air-plane.\n",
    "It is my air-plane.\u201d And I was proud to have him \nlearn that I could fly.\nHe cried out, then: \u201cWhat!\n",
    "You dropped down from the sky?\u201d \n\n\u201cYes,\u201d I answered, modestly.\n\n\n\u201cOh!\nThat is funny!\u201d And the little prince broke into a lovely peal of laughter, which irritated me \n",
    "very much.\nI like my misfortunes to be taken seriously.\n\nThen he added: \u201cSo you, too, come from the sky!\n",
    "Which is your planet?\u201d At that moment I caught \na gleam of light in the impenetrable mystery of his presence; and I demanded, abruptly: \u201cDo you \n",
    "come from another planet?\u201d But he did not reply.\nHe tossed his head gently, without taking his \neyes from my plane: \u201cIt is true that on that you can\u2019t have come from very far away\u2026\u201d And he \n",
    "sank into a reverie, which lasted a long time.\nThen, taking my sheep out of his pocket, he buried \nhimself in the contemplation of his treasure.\n",
    "\nYou can imagine how my curiosity was aroused by this half-confidence about the \u201cother planets.\u201d I \n",
    "made a great effort, therefore, to find out more on this subject.\n\n\u201cMy little man, where do you come from?\n",
    "What is this \u2018where I live,\u2019 of which you speak?\nWhere \ndo you want to take your sheep?\u201d \nAfter a reflective silence he answered: \u201cThe thing that is so good about the box you have given \n",
    "me is that at night he can use it as his house.\u201d \n\u201cThat is so.\nAnd if you are good I will give you a string, too, so that you can tie him during the day, \n",
    "and a post to tie him to.\u201d \nBut the little prince seemed shocked by this offer: \u201cTie him!\nWhat a queer idea!\u201d \n",
    "\u201cBut if you don\u2019t tie him,\u201d I said, \u201che will wander off somewhere, and get lost.\u201d \nMy friend broke into another peal of laughter: \u201cBut where do you think he would go?\u201d \n",
    "\u201cAnywhere.\nStraight ahead of him.\u201d \nThen the little prince said, earnestly: \u201cThat doesn\u2019t matter.\nWhere I live, everything is so small!\u201d \n",
    "And, with perhaps a hint of sadness, he added: \u201cStraight ahead of him, nobody can go very far\u2026\u201d \n\n\nI had thus learned a second fact of great importance: this was that the planet the little prince \n",
    "came from was scarcely any larger than a house!\nBut that did not really surprise me much.\nI knew \nvery well that in addition to the great planets, such as the Earth, Jupiter, Mars, Venus, to which \n",
    "we have given names, there are also hundreds of others, some of which are so small that one has \na hard time seeing them through the telescope.\n",
    "\n\nWhen an astronomer discovers one of these he does not give it a name, but only a number.\nHe \nmight call it, for example, \u201cAsteroid 325.\u201d \n",
    "\n\nI have serious reason to believe that the planet from which the little prince came is the asteroid \n",
    "known as B-612.\nThis asteroid has only once been seen through the telescope.\nThat was by a \nTurkish astronomer, in 1909.\n",
    "\nOn making his discovery, the astronomer had presented it to the International Astronomical \nCongress, in a great demonstration.\n",
    "But he was in Turkish costume, and so nobody would believe \nwhat he said.\nGrown-ups are like that\u2026 \n",
    "Fortunately, however, for the reputation of Asteroid B-612, a Turkish dictator made a law that his \n",
    "subjects, under pain of death, should change to European costume.\nSo in 1920 the astronomer \ngave his demonstration all over again, dressed with impressive style and elegance.\n",
    "And this time \neverybody accepted his report.\n\nIf I have told you these details about the asteroid, and made a note of its number for you, it is on \n",
    "account of the grown-ups and their ways.\nWhen you tell them that you have made a new friend, \nthey never ask you any questions about essential matters.\n",
    "They never say to you, \u201cWhat does his \nvoice sound like?\nWhat games does he love best?\nDoes he collect butterflies?\u201d Instead, they \n",
    "demand: \u201cHow old is he?\nHow many brothers has he?\nHow much does he weigh?\nHow much \nmoney does his father make?\u201d \n",
    "Only from these figures do they think they have learned anything about him.\n\nIf you were to say to the grown-ups: \u201cI saw a beautiful house made of rosy brick, with geraniums \n",
    "in the windows and doves on the roof,\u201d they would not be able to get any idea of that house at all.\n",
    "\nYou would have to say to them: \u201cI saw a house that cost $ 20,000.\u201d Then they would exclaim: \u201cOh, \nwhat a pretty house that is!\u201d Just so, you might say to them: \u201cThe proof that the little prince \n",
    "existed is that he was charming, that he laughed, and that he was looking for a sheep.\nIf anybody \nwants a sheep, that is a proof that he exists.\u201d And what good would it do to tell them that?\n",
    "They \nwould shrug their shoulders, and treat you like a child.\nBut if you said to them: \u201cThe planet he \n",
    "came from is Asteroid B-612,\u201d then they would be convinced, and leave you in peace from their \nquestions.\n",
    "They are like that.\nOne must not hold it against them.\nChildren should always show \ngreat forbearance toward grown-up people.\n",
    "But certainly, for us who understand life, figures are a \nmatter of indifference.\n\nI should have liked to begin this story in the fashion of the fairy-tales.\n",
    "I should have like to say: \n\u201cOnce upon a time there was a little prince who lived on a planet that was scarcely any bigger \n",
    "\nthan himself, and who had need of a sheep\u2026\u201d \n\nTo those who understand life, that would have given a much greater air of truth to my story.\n",
    "Fori \ndo not want any one to read my book carelessly.\nI have suffered too much grief in setting down \n",
    "these memories.\nSix years have already passed since my friend went away from me, with his \nsheep.\nIf I try to describe him here, it is to make sure that I shall not forget him.\n",
    "To forget a friend \nis sad.\nNot every one has had a friend.\nAnd if I forget him, I may become like the grown-ups who \n",
    "are no longer interested in anything but figures\u2026 It is for that purpose, again, that I have bought a \n",
    "box of paints and some pencils.\n\nIt is hard to take up drawing again at my age, when I have never made any pictures except those \n",
    "of the boa constrictor from the outside and the boa constrictor from the inside, since I was six.\nI \n",
    "shall certainly try to make my portraits as true to life as possible.\nBut I am not at all sure of \nsuccess.\n",
    "One drawing goes along all right, and another has no resemblance to its subject.\nI make \nsome errors, too, in the little prince\u2019s height: in one place he is too tall and in another too short.\n",
    "And I feel some doubts about the colour of his costume.\nSo I fumble along as best I can, now good, \n",
    "now bad, and I hope generally fair-to- middling.\nIn certain more important details I shall make \nmistakes, also.\n",
    "But that is something that will not be my fault.\nMy friend never explained anything \nto me.\nHe thought, perhaps, that I was like himself.\n",
    "But I, alas, do not know how to see sheep \nthrough the walls of boxes.\nPerhaps I am a little like the grown-ups.\n",
    "I have had to grow old.\n\nAs each day passed I would learn, in our talk, something about the little prince\u2019s planet, his \n",
    "departure from it, his journey.\nThe information would come very slowly, as it might chance to fall \n",
    "from his thoughts.\nIt was in this way that I heard, on the third day, about the catastrophe of the \n",
    "baobabs.\n\nThis time, once more, I had the sheep to thank for it.\nFor the little prince asked me abruptly, as if \n",
    "seized by a grave doubt, \n\u201cIt is true, isn\u2019t it, that sheep eat little bushes?\u201d \n\u201cYes, that is true.\u201d \n",
    "\u201cAh!\nI am glad!\u201d \nI did not understand why it was so important that sheep should eat little bushes.\n",
    "But the little \nprince added: \u201cThen it follows that they also eat baobabs?\u201d I pointed out to the little prince that \n",
    "baobabs were not little bushes, but, on the contrary, trees as big as castles; and that even if he \n",
    "took a whole herd of elephants away with him, the herd would not eat up one single baobab.\n\nThe idea of the herd of elephants made the little prince laugh.\n",
    "\u201cWe would have to put them one on \ntop of the other,\u201d he said.\nBut he made a wise comment: \n\u201cBefore they grow so big, the baobabs start out by being little.\u201d \n",
    "\u201cThat is strictly correct,\u201d I said.\n\u201cBut why do you want the sheep to eat the little baobabs?\u201d \nHe answered me at once, \u201cOh, come, come!\u201d, as if he were speaking of something that was self- \n",
    "evident.\nAnd I was obliged to make a great mental effort to solve this problem, without any \nassistance.\n",
    "\nIndeed, as I learned, there were on the planet where the little prince lived, as on all planets, good \n",
    "\n\nplants and bad plants.\nIn consequence, there were good seeds from good plants, and bad seeds \nfrom bad plants.\n",
    "But seeds are invisible.\nThey sleep deep in the heart of the earth\u2019s darkness, \nuntil some one among them is seized with the desire to awaken.\n",
    "Then this little seed will stretch \nitself and begin, timidly at first, to push a charming little sprig inoffensively upward toward the \n",
    "sun.\nIf it is only a sprout of radish or the sprig of a rose-bush, one would let it grow wherever it \n",
    "might wish.\nBut when it is a bad plant, one must destroy it as soon as possible, the very first \ninstant that one recognises it.\n",
    "\nNow there were some terrible seeds on the planet that was the home of the little prince; and these \n",
    "were the seeds of the baobab.\nThe soil of that planet was infested with them.\nA baobab is \nsomething you will never, never be able to get rid of if you attend to it too late.\n",
    "It spreads over the \nentire planet.\nIt bores clear through it with its roots.\nAnd if the planet is too small, and the \n",
    "baobabs are too many, they split it in pieces\u2026 \n\u201cIt is a question of discipline,\u201d the little prince said to me later on.\n",
    "\n\u201cWhen you\u2019ve finished your own toilet in the morning, then it is time to attend to the toilet of your \n",
    "planet, just so, with the greatest care.\nYou must see to it that you pull up regularly all the baobabs, \n",
    "at the very first moment when they can be distinguished from the rosebushes, which they \nresemble so closely in their earliest youth.\n",
    "It is very tedious work,\u201d the little prince added, \u201cbut \nvery easy.\u201d And one day he said to me: \u201cYou ought to make a beautiful drawing, so that the \n",
    "children where you live can see exactly how all this is.\nThat would be very useful to them if they \n",
    "were to travel some day.\n\n\nSometimes,\u201d he added, \u201cthere is no harm in putting off a piece of work until another day.\n",
    "But \nwhen it is a matter of baobabs, that always means a catastrophe.\n\nI knew a planet that was inhabited by a lazy man.\n",
    "He neglected three little bushes\u2026 So, as the \nlittle prince described it to me, I have made a drawing of that planet.\n",
    "I do not much like to take \nthe tone of a moralist.\nBut the danger of the baobabs is so little understood, and such considerable \n",
    "risks would be run by anyone who might get lost on an asteroid, that for once I am breaking \nthrough my reserve.\n",
    "\u201cChildren,\u201d I say plainly, \u201cwatch out for the baobabs!\u201d My friends, like \nmyself, have been skirting this danger for a long time, without ever knowing it; and so it is for \n",
    "them that I have worked so hard over this drawing.\n\nThe lesson which I pass on by this means is worth all the trouble it has cost me.\n",
    "Perhaps you will \nask me, \u201cWhy are there no other drawing in this book as magnificent and impressive as this \n",
    "drawing of the baobabs?\u201d The reply is simple.\nI have tried.\nBut with the others I have not been \nsuccessful.\n",
    "When I made the drawing of the baobabs I was carried beyond myself by the inspiring \nforce of urgent necessity.\n",
    "\nOh, little prince!\nBit by bit I came to understand the secrets of your sad little life\u2026 For a long time \n",
    "you had found your only entertainment in the quiet pleasure of looking at the sunset.\n\nI learned that new detail on the morning of the fourth day, when you said to me: \n",
    "\u201cI am very fond of sunsets.\nCome, let us go look at a sunset now.\u201d \n\u201cBut we must wait,\u201d I said.\n\n\u201cWait?\n",
    "For what?\u201d \n\u201cFor the sunset.\nWe must wait until it is time.\u201d \nAt first you seemed to be very much surprised.\n",
    "And then you laughed to yourself.\nYou said to me: \n\u201cI am always thinking that I am at home!\u201d \nJust so.\n",
    "Everybody knows that when it is noon in the United States the sun is setting over France.\nIf you could fly to France in one minute, you could go straight into the sunset, right from noon.\n",
    "Unfortunately, France is too far away for that.\nBut on your tiny planet, my little prince, all you \n",
    "need do is move your chair a few steps.\nYou can see the day end and the twilight falling whenever \nyou like\u2026 \n",
    "\u201cOne day,\u201d you said to me, \u201cI saw the sunset forty-four times!\u201d \nAnd a little later you added: \u201cYou know, one loves the sunset, when one is so sad\u2026\u201d \u201cWere you so \n",
    "sad, then?\u201d I asked, \u201con the day of the forty-four sunsets?\u201d \nBut the little prince made no reply.\n\n",
    "On the fifth day, again, as always, it was thanks to the sheep, the secret of the little prince\u2019s life \n",
    "was revealed to me.\n\nAbruptly, without anything to lead up to it, and as if the question had been born of long and silent \n",
    "meditation on his problem, he demanded: \u201cA sheep; if it eats little bushes, does it eat flowers, \ntoo?\u201d \n",
    "\n\n\u201cA sheep,\u201d I answered, \u201ceats anything it finds in its reach.\u201d \n\n\u201cEven flowers that have thorns?\u201d \n",
    "\u201cYes, even flowers that have thorns.\u201d \n\u201cThen the thorns, what use are they?\u201d I did not know.\n\nAt that moment I was very busy trying to unscrew a bolt that had got stuck in my engine.\n",
    "I was \nvery much worried, for it was becoming clear to me that the breakdown of my plane was \nextremely serious.\n",
    "And I had so little drinking water left that I had to fear for the worst.\n\n\u201cThe thorns, what use are they?\u201d \n",
    "The little prince never let go of a question, once he had asked it.\nAs for me, I was upset over that \n",
    "bolt.\nAnd I answered with the first thing that came into my head: \u201cThe thorns are of no use at all.\n",
    "Flowers have thorns just for spite!\u201d \n\u201cOh!\u201d There was a moment of complete silence.\n\nThen the little prince flashed back at me, with a kind of resentfulness: \u201cI don\u2019t believe you!\n",
    "Flowers are weak creatures.\nThey are naive.\nThey reassure themselves as best they can.\nThey \nbelieve that their thorns are terrible weapons\u2026\u201d \n",
    "I did not answer.\nAt that instant I was saying to myself: \u201cIf this bolt still won\u2019t turn, I am going to \n",
    "knock it out with the hammer.\u201d \nAgain the little prince disturbed my thoughts.\n\u201cAnd you actually believe that the flowers\u2026\u201d \n",
    "\u201cOh, no!\u201d I cried.\n\u201cNo, no no!\nI don\u2019t believe anything.\nI answered you with the first thing that \ncame into my head.\n",
    "Don\u2019t you see, I am very busy with matters of consequence!\u201d \nHe stared at me, thunderstruck.\n\u201cMatters of consequence!\u201d \n",
    "He looked at me there, with my hammer in my hand, my fingers black with engine grease, bending \ndown over an object which seemed to him extremely ugly\u2026 \n",

    "He was really very angry.\nHe tossed his golden curls in the breeze.\n\n\u201cI know a planet where there is a certain red-faced gentleman.\n",
    "He has never smelled a flower.\nHe \nhas never looked at a star.\nHe has never loved any one.\nHe has never done anything in his life but \n",
    "add up figures.\nAnd all day he says over and over, just like you: \u2018I am busy with matters of \nconsequence!\u2019 And that makes him swell up with pride.\n",

    "\u201cThe flowers have been growing thorns \nfor millions of years.\nFor millions of years the sheep have been eating them just the same.\n",

    "\n\n' ' \nI \\ \n\n\nthorns, which are never of any use to them?\nIs the warfare between the sheep and the flowers not \n",
    "important?\nIs this not of more consequence than a fat red-faced gentleman\u2019s sums?\nAnd if I know, \nI, myself, one flower which is unique in the world, which grows nowhere but on my planet, but \n",
    "which one little sheep can destroy in a single bite some morning, without even noticing what he is \n",
    "doing, Oh!\nYou think that is not important!\nHis face turned from white to red as he continued: \u201cIf \n",
    "some one loves a flower, of which just one single blossom grows in all the millions and millions of \n",
    "stars, it is enough to make him happy just to look at the stars.\n\nHe can say to himself, \u2018Somewhere, my flower is there\u2026\u2019 But if the sheep eats the flower, in one \n",
    "moment all his stars will be darkened\u2026 And you think that is not important!\u201d \nHe could not say anything more.\n",
    "His words were choked by sobbing.\nThe night had fallen.\nI had \nlet my tools drop from my hands.\nOf what moment now was my hammer, my bolt, or thirst, or \n",
    "death?\nOn one star, one planet, my planet, the Earth, there was a little prince to be comforted.\nI \n",
    "took him in my arms, and rocked him.\nI said to him: \u201cThe flower that you love is not in danger.\nI \nwill draw you a muzzle for your sheep.\n",
    "I will draw you a railing to put around your flower.\nI will\u2026\u201d \nI did not know what to say to him.\nI felt awkward and blundering.\n",
    "I did not know how I could reach \nhim, where I could overtake him and go on hand in hand with him once more.\n",
    "\nIt is such a secret place, the land of tears.\n\nI soon learned to know this flower better.\nOn the little prince\u2019s planet the flowers had always been \n",
    "very simple.\nThey had only one ring of petals; they took up no room at all; they were a trouble to \n",
    "nobody.\nOne morning they would appear in the grass, and by night they would have faded \npeacefully away.\n",
    "But one day, from a seed blown from no one knew where, a new flower had come \nup; and the little prince had watched very closely over this small sprout which was not like any \n",
    "other small sprouts on his planet.\n\nIt might, you see, have been a new kind of baobab.\nThe shrub soon stopped growing, and began to \n",
    "get ready to produce a flower.\nThe little prince, who was present at the first appearance of a huge \n",
    "bud, felt at once that some sort of miraculous apparition must emerge from it.\nBut the flower was \nnot satisfied to complete the preparations for her beauty in the shelter of her green chamber.\n",
    "She \n\nchose her colours with the greatest care.\nShe adjusted her petals one by one.\nShe did not wish to \n",
    "go out into the world all rumpled, like the field poppies.\nIt was only in the full radiance of her \n",
    "beauty that she wished to appear.\nOh, yes!\nShe was a coquettish creature!\nAnd her mysterious \nadornment lasted for days and days.\n",
    "Then one morning, exactly at sunrise, she suddenly showed \nherself.\nAnd, after working with all this painstaking precision, she yawned and said: \u201cAh!\n",
    "I am \nscarcely awake.\nI beg that you will excuse me.\nMy petals are still all disarranged\u2026\u201d But the little \n",
    "prince could not restrain his admiration: \n\u201cOh!\nHow beautiful you are!\u201d \n\u201cAm I not?\u201d the flower responded, sweetly.\n",
    "\u201cAnd I was born at the same moment as the sun\u2026\u201d \nThe little prince could guess easily enough that she was not any too modest, but how moving, and \n",
    "exciting she was!\n\n\u201cI think it is time for breakfast,\u201d she added an instant later.\n\u201cIf you would have the kindness to \n",
    "think of my needs\u201d And the little prince, completely abashed, went to look for a sprinkling can of \n",
    "fresh water.\n\nSo, he tended the flower.\nSo, too, she began very quickly to torment him with her vanity, which \n",
    "was, if the truth be known, a little difficult to deal with.\n\nOne day, for instance, when she was speaking of her four thorns, she said to the little prince: \u201cLet \n",
    "the tigers come with their claws!\u201d \n\u201cThere are no tigers on my planet,\u201d the little prince objected.\n",
    "\u201cAnd, anyway, tigers do not eat \nweeds.\u201d \n\u201cI am not a weed,\u201d the flower replied, sweetly.\n\u201cPlease excuse me\u2026\u201d \u201cI am not at all afraid of \n",
    "tigers,\u201d she went on, \u201cbut I have a horror of drafts.\nI suppose you wouldn\u2019t screen for me?\" \n\u201cA horror of drafts, that is bad luck, for a plant,\u201d remarked the little prince, and added to himself, \n",
    "\u201cThis flower is a very complex creature\u2026\u201d \n\u201cAt night I want you to put me under a glass globe.\nIt is very cold where you live.\n",
    "In the place I \ncame from\u2026\u201d But she interrupted herself at that point.\nShe had come in the form of a seed.\n",
    "She \ncould not have known anything of any other worlds.\n\nEmbarrassed over having let herself be caught on the verge of such an untruth, she coughed two \n",
    "or three times, in order to put the little prince in the wrong.\n\n\u201cThe screen?\u201d \n\u201cI was just going to look for it when you spoke to me\u2026\u201d \n",
    "Then she forced her cough a little more so that he should suffer from remorse just the same.\nSo \nthe little prince, in spite of all the good will that was inseparable from his love, had soon come to \n",
    "doubt her.\nHe had taken seriously words which were without importance, and it made him very \nunhappy.\n",
    "\n\u201cI ought not to have listened to her,\u201d he confided to me one day.\n\n\u201cOne never ought to listen to the flowers.\n",
    "One should simply look at them and breathe their \n\n\nfragrance.\nMine perfumed all my planet.\nBut I did not know how to take pleasure in all her grace.\n",
    "This tale of claws, which disturbed me so much, should only have filled my heart with tenderness \nand pity.\u201d \n",
    "And he continued his confidences: \u201cThe fact is that I did not know how to understand anything!\nI \nought to have judged by deeds and not by words.\n",
    "She cast her fragrance and her radiance over \nme.\nI ought never to have run away from her\u2026 I ought to have guessed all the affection that lay \n",
    "behind her poor little stratagems.\nFlowers are so inconsistent!\nBut I was too young to know how to \n",
    "love her\u2026\u201d \nI believe that for his escape he took advantage of the migration of a flock of wild birds.\n",
    "On the \nmorning of his departure he put his planet in perfect order.\nHe carefully cleaned out his active \n",
    "volcanoes.\nHe possessed two active volcanoes; and they were very convenient for heating his \nbreakfast in the morning.\n",
    "He also had one volcano that was extinct.\nBut, as he said, \u201cOne never \nknows!\u201d So he cleaned out the extinct volcano, too.\n",
    "If they are well cleaned out, volcanoes burn \nslowly and steadily, without any eruptions.\nVolcanic eruptions are like fires in a chimney.\n",
    "\nOn our earth we are obviously much too small to clean out our volcanoes.\nThat is why they bring \nno end of trouble upon us.\n",
    "The little prince also pulled up, with a certain sense of dejection, the \nlast little shoots of the baobabs.\n",
    "He believed that he would never want to return.\nBut on this last \nmorning all these familiar tasks seemed very precious to him.\n",
    "And when he watered the flower for \nthe last time, and prepared to place her under the shelter of her glass globe, he realised that he \n",
    "was very close to tears.\n\u201cGoodbye,\u201d he said to the flower.\nBut she made no answer.\n\u201cGoodbye,\u201d \nhe said again.\n",
    "The flower coughed.\nBut it was not because she had a cold.\n\n\u201cI have been silly,\u201d she said to him, at last.\n",
    "\u201cI ask your forgiveness.\nTry to be happy\u2026\u201d He was \nsurprised by this absence of reproaches.\nHe stood there all bewildered, the glass globe held \n",
    "arrested in mid-air.\nHe did not understand this quiet sweetness.\n\n\u201cOf course I love you,\u201d the flower said to him.\n",
    "\u201cIt is my fault that you have not known it all the \nwhile.\nThat is of no importance.\nBut you, you have been just as foolish as I.\n",
    "Try to be happy\u2026 let \nthe glass globe be.\nI don\u2019t want it any more.\u201d \n\u201cBut the wind\u2026\u201d \u201cMy cold is not so bad as all that\u2026 the cool night air will do me good.\n",
    "I am a \nflower.\u201d \n\u201cBut the animals\u2026\u201d \u201cWell, I must endure the presence of two or three caterpillars if I wish to \n",
    "become acquainted with the butterflies.\nIt seems that they are very beautiful.\nAnd if not the \nbutterflies and the caterpillars who will call upon me?\n",
    "You will be far away\u2026 as for the large \nanimals, I am not at all afraid of any of them.\nI have my claws.\u201d \n",
    "And, naively, she showed her four thorns.\n\nThen she added: \u201cDon\u2019t linger like this.\nYou have decided to go away.\n",
    "Now go!\u201d \nFor she did not want him to see her crying.\nShe was such a proud flower\u2026 \n\nHe found himself in the neighbourhood of the asteroids 325, 326, 327, 328, 329, and 330.\n",
    "He \nbegan, therefore, by visiting them, in order to add to his knowledge.\nThe first of them was \ninhabited by a king.\n",
    "Clad in royal purple and ermine, he was seated upon a throne, which was at \n\n\nthe same time both simple and majestic.\n",
    "\n\n\u201cAh!\nHere is a subject,\u201d exclaimed the king, when he saw the little prince coming.\nAnd the little \n",
    "prince asked himself: \u201cHow could he recognise me when he had never seen me before?\u201d \nHe did not know how the world is simplified for kings.\n",
    "To them, all men are subjects.\n\u201cApproach, \nso that I may see you better,\u201d said the king, who felt consumingly proud of being at last a king \n",
    "over somebody.\n\nThe little prince looked everywhere to find a place to sit down; but the entire planet was crammed \n",
    "and obstructed by the king\u2019s magnificent ermine robe.\nSo he remained standing upright, and, since \nhe was tired, he yawned.\n",
    "\n\u201cIt is contrary to etiquette to yawn in the presence of a king,\u201d the monarch said to him.\n\u201cI forbid \n",
    "you to do so.\u201d \n\u201cI can\u2019t help it.\nI can\u2019t stop myself,\u201d replied the little prince, thoroughly embarrassed.\n",
    "\n\u201cI have come on a long journey, and I have had no sleep\u2026\u201d \n\u201cAh, then,\u201d the king said.\n\u201cI order you to yawn.\n",
    "It is years since I have seen anyone yawning.\nYawns, to me, are objects of curiosity.\nCome, now!\nYawn again!\n",
    "It is an order.\u201d \n\u201cThat frightens me\u2026 I cannot, any more\u2026\u201d murmured the little prince, now completely abashed.\n",
    "\n\u201cHum!\nHum!\u201d replied the king.\n\u201cThen I\u2026 I order you sometimes to yawn and sometimes to\u201d He \nsputtered a little, and seemed vexed.\n",
    "For what the king fundamentally insisted upon was that his \nauthority should be respected.\nHe tolerated no disobedience.\n",
    "He was an absolute monarch.\nBut, \nbecause he was a very good man, he made his orders reasonable.\n\n\u201cIf I ordered a general,\u201d he would say, by way of example, \u201cif I ordered a general to change \n",
    "himself into a sea bird, and if the general did not obey me, that would not be the fault of the \ngeneral.\n",
    "It would be my fault.\u201d \n\u201cMay I sit down?\u201d came now a timid inquiry from the little prince.\n\u201cI order you to do so,\u201d the king \n",
    "answered him, and majestically gathered in a fold of his ermine mantle.\nBut the little prince was \nwondering\u2026 The planet was tiny.\n",
    "Over what could this king really rule?\n\n\u201cSire,\u201d he said to him, \u201cI beg that you will excuse my asking you a question\u201d \n",
    "\u201cI order you to ask me a question,\u201d the king hastened to assure him.\n\u201cSire, over what do you \nrule?\u201d \u201cOver everything,\u201d said the king, with magnificent simplicity.\n",
    "\n\u201cOver everything?\u201d The king made a gesture, which took in his planet, the other planets, and all \nthe stars.\n",
    "\u201cOver all that?\u201d asked the little prince.\n\u201cOver all that,\u201d the king answered.\nFor his rule \nwas not only absolute: it was also universal.\n",
    "\u201cAnd the stars obey you?\u201d \u201cCertainly they do,\u201d the \nking said.\n\u201cThey obey instantly.\nI do not permit insubordination.\u201d \n",
    "Such power was a thing for the little prince to marvel at.\nIf he had been master of such complete \nauthority, he would have been able to watch the sunset, not forty-four times in one day, but \n",
    "seventy-two, or even a hundred, or even two hundred times, with out ever having to move his \nchair.\n",
    "And because he felt a bit sad as he remembered his little planet, which he had forsaken, he \nplucked up his courage to ask the king a favour: \n",
    "\n\n\u201cI should like to see a sunset\u2026 do me that kindness\u2026 Order the sun to set\u2026\u201d \n\u201cIf I ordered a general to fly from one flower to another like a butterfly, or to write a tragic \n",
    "drama, or to change himself into a sea bird, and if the general did not carry out the order that he \n",
    "had received, which one of us would be in the wrong?\u201d the king demanded.\n\u201cThe general, or \nmyself?\u201d \n",
    "\u201cYou,\u201d said the little prince firmly.\n\n\u201cExactly.\nOne much require from each one the duty which each one can perform,\u201d the king went \n",
    "on.\n\u201cAccepted authority rests first of all on reason.\nIf you ordered your people to go and throw \nthemselves into the sea, they would rise up in revolution.\n",
    "I have the right to require obedience \nbecause my orders are reasonable.\u201d \n\u201cThen my sunset?\u201d the little prince reminded him: for he never forgot a question once he had \n",
    "asked it.\n\n\u201cYou shall have your sunset.\nI shall command it.\nBut, according to my science of government, I \n",
    "shall wait until conditions are favourable.\u201d \n\u201cWhen will that be?\u201d inquired the little prince.\n\u201cHum!\n",
    "Hum!\u201d replied the king; and before saying \nanything else he consulted a bulky almanac.\n\u201cHum!\nHum!\nThat will be about\u2026 about\u2026 that will be \n",
    "this evening about twenty minutes to eight.\nAnd you will see how well I am obeyed.\u201d \nThe little prince yawned.\n",
    "He was regretting his lost sunset.\nAnd then, too, he was already \nbeginning to be a little bored.\n\u201cI have nothing more to do here,\u201d he said to the king.\n",
    "\u201cSo I shall set \nout on my way again.\u201d \u201cDo not go,\u201d said the king, who was very proud of having a subject.\n",
    "\u201cDo \nnot go.\nI will make you a Minister!\u201d \u201cMinister of what?\u201d \u201cMinster of\u2026of Justice!\u201d \u201cBut there is \n",
    "nobody here to judge!\u201d \u201cWe do not know that,\u201d the king said to him.\n\u201cI have not yet made a \ncomplete tour of my kingdom.\n",
    "I am very old.\nThere is no room here for a carriage.\nAnd it tires me \nto walk.\u201d \u201cOh, but I have looked already!\u201d said the little prince, turning around to give one more \n",
    "glance to the other side of the planet.\n\nOn that side, as on this, there was nobody at all\u2026 \u201cThen you shall judge yourself,\u201d the king \n",
    "answered, \u201cthat is the most difficult thing of all.\nIt is much more difficult to j udge oneself than to \n",
    "j udge others.\nIf you succeed in j udging yourself rightly, then you are indeed a man of true \nwisdom.\u201d \n",
    "\n\u201cYes,\u201d said the little prince, \u201cbut I can judge myself anywhere.\nI do not need to live on this planet.\n",
    "\u201cHum!\nHum!\u201d said the king.\n\u201cI have good reason to believe that somewhere on my planet there is \nan old rat.\n",
    "I hear him at night.\nYou can judge this old rat.\nFrom time to time you will condemn him \nto death.\nThus his life will depend on your j ustice.\n",
    "But you will pardon him on each occasion; for \nhe must be treated thriftily.\nHe is the only one we have.\u201d \n",
    "\u201cI,\u201d replied the little prince, \u201cdo not like to condemn anyone to death.\nAnd now I think I will go on \n",
    "my way.\u201d \u201cNo,\u201d said the king.\nBut the little prince, having now completed his preparations for \ndeparture, had no wish to grieve the old monarch.\n",
    "\u201cIf Your Majesty wishes to be promptly \nobeyed,\u201d he said, \u201che should be able to give me a reasonable order.\n",
    "He should be able, for \nexample, to order me to be gone by the end of one minute.\nIt seems to me that conditions are \n",
    "favourable\u2026\u201d As the king made no answer, the little prince hesitated a moment.\n\nThen, with a sigh, he took his leave.\n",
    "\u201cI made you my Ambassador,\u201d the king called out, hastily.\n\nHe had a magnificent air of authority.\n\n\u201cThe grown-ups are very strange,\u201d the little prince said to himself, as he continued on his journey.\n",
    "The second planet was inhabited by a conceited man.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cAh!\nAh!\nI am about to receive a visit from an admirer!\u201d he exclaimed from afar, when he first \n",
    "saw the little prince coming.\nFor, to conceited men, all other men are admirers.\n\n\u201cGood morning,\u201d said the little prince.\n",
    "\u201cThat is a queer hat you are wearing.\u201d \n\u201cIt is a hat for salutes,\u201d the conceited man replied.\n\u201cIt is to raise in salute when people acclaim \n",
    "me.\nUnfortunately, nobody at all ever passes this way.\u201d \n\u201cYes?\u201d said the little prince, who did not understand what the conceited man was talking about.\n",
    "\n\u201cClap your hands, one against the other,\u201d the conceited man now directed him.\nThe little prince \nclapped his hands.\n",
    "The conceited man raised his hat in a modest salute.\n\u201cThis is more entertaining \nthan the visit to the king,\u201d the little prince said to himself.\n",
    "And he began again to clap his hands, \none against the other.\nThe conceited man against raised his hat in salute.\n",
    "After five minutes of \n\nthis exercise the little prince grew tired of the game\u2019s monotony.\n\u201cAnd what should one do to \n",
    "make the hat come down?\u201d he asked.\nBut the conceited man did not hear him.\nConceited people \nnever hear anything but praise.\n",
    "\n\u201cDo you really admire me very much?\u201d he demanded of the little prince.\n\u201cWhat does that mean, \n\u2018admire\u2019?\u201d \n",
    "\u201cTo admire means that you regard me as the handsomest, the best-dressed, the richest, and the \nmost intelligent man on this planet.\u201d \u201cBut you are the only man on your planet!\u201d \u201cDo me this \n",
    "kindness.\nAdmire me just the same.\u201d \n\u201cI admire you,\u201d said the little prince, shrugging his shoulders slightly, \u201cbut what is there in that to \n",
    "interest you so much?\u201d \nAnd the little prince went away.\n\u201cThe grown-ups are certainly very odd,\u201d he said to himself, as he \n",
    "continued on his journey.\n\nThe next planet was inhabited by a tippler.\n\n\nThis was a very short visit, but it plunged the little prince into deep dejection.\n",
    "\u201cWhat are you \ndoing there?\u201d he said to the tippler, whom he found settled down in silence before a collection of \n",
    "empty bottles and also a collection of full bottles.\n\n\u201cI am drinking,\u201d replied the tippler, with a lugubrious air.\n",
    "\n\u201cWhy are you drinking?\u201d demanded the little prince.\n\n\u201cSo that I may forget,\u201d replied the tippler.\n\u201cForget what?\u201d inquired the little prince, who already \n",
    "was sorry for him.\n\n\u201cForget that I am ashamed,\u201d the tippler confessed, hanging his head.\n\n\u201cAshamed of what?\u201d insisted the little prince, who wanted to help him.\n",
    "\n\u201cAshamed of drinking!\u201d The tippler brought his speech to an end, and shut himself up in an \nimpregnable silence.\n",
    "\nAnd the little prince went away, puzzled.\n\u201cThe grown-ups are certainly very, very odd,\u201d he said to \n",
    "himself, as he continued on his journey.\n\nThe fourth planet belonged to a businessman.\n\nThis man was so much occupied that he did not even raise his head at the little prince\u2019s arrival.\n",
    "\n\n\u201cGood morning,\u201d the little prince said to him.\n\u201cYour cigarette has gone out.\u201d \n\n\u201cThree and two make five.\n",
    "Five and seven make twelve.\nTwelve and three make fifteen.\nGood \nmorning.\nFifteen and seven make twenty-two.\n",
    "Twenty-two and six make twenty-eight.\nI haven\u2019t \ntime to light it again.\nTwenty-six and five make thirty-one.\n",

    "I am concerned with matters of consequence.\nI \ndon\u2019t amuse myself with balderdash.\nTwo and five make seven\u2026\u201d \n",
    "\u201cFive-hundred-and-one million what?\u201d repeated the little prince, who never in his life had let go of \n",
    "a question once he had asked it.\n\nThe businessman raised his head.\n\u201cDuring the fifty-four years that I have inhabited this planet, I \n",
    "have been disturbed only three times.\nThe first time was twenty-two years ago, when some giddy \ngoose fell from goodness knows where.\n",

    "For it is possible for a man to be faithful and lazy at \nthe same time.\n\n\nThe little prince went on with his explanation: \u201cYour planet is so small that three strides will take \n",

    "Nevertheless he is the only one of them all who does not seem to me ridiculous.\nPerhaps that is because he is thinking of something else besides himself.\u201d \n",

    "\n\u201cYour planet is very beautiful,\u201d he said.\n\u201cHas it any oceans?\u201d \n\u201cI couldn\u2019t tell you,\u201d said the geographer.\n",
    "\n\u201cAh!\u201d The little prince was disappointed.\n\u201cHas it any mountains?\u201d \n\u201cI couldn\u2019t tell you,\u201d said the geographer.\n",
    "\n\u201cAnd towns, and rivers, and deserts?\u201d \n\u201cI couldn\u2019t tell you that, either.\u201d \n\u201cBut you are a geographer!\u201d \n",
    "\u201cExactly,\u201d the geographer said.\n\u201cBut I am not an explorer.\nI haven\u2019t a single explorer on my \nplanet.\n",
    "It is not the geographer who goes out to count the towns, the rivers, the mountains, the \nseas, the oceans, and the deserts.\n",
    "The geographer is much too important to go loafing about.\nHe \ndoes not leave his desk.\nBut he receives the explorers in his study.\n",
    "He asks them questions, and \nhe notes down what they recall of their travels.\nAnd if the recollections of any one among them \n",
    "seem interesting to him, the geographer orders an inquiry into that explorer\u2019s moral character.\u201d \n\u201cWhy is that?\u201d \n",
    "\u201cBecause an explorer who told lies would bring disaster on the books of the geographer.\nSo would \nan explorer who drank too much.\u201d \n",
    "\u201cWhy is that?\u201d asked the little prince.\n\n\u201cBecause intoxicated men see double.\nThen the geographer would note down two mountains in a \n",
    "place where there was only one.\u201d \n\u201cI know some one,\u201d said the little prince, \u201cwho would make a bad explorer.\u201d \n",
    "\u201cThat is possible.\nThen, when the moral character of the explorer is shown to be good, an inquiry \nis ordered into his discovery.\u201d \n",
    "\u201cOne goes to see it?\u201d \n\u201cNo.\nThat would be too complicated.\nBut one requires the explorer to furnish proofs.\n",
    "For example, \nif the discovery in question is that of a large mountain, one requires that large stones be brought \n",
    "back from it.\u201d The geographer was suddenly stirred to excitement.\n\u201cBut you come from far away!\nYou are an explorer!\n",
    "You shall describe your planet to me!\u201d And, having opened his big register, \nthe geographer sharpened his pencil.\n",
    "The recitals of explorers are put down first in pencil.\nOne \nwaits until the explorer has furnished proofs, before putting them down in ink.\n",
    "\u201cWell?\u201d said the \ngeographer expectantly.\n\n\u201cOh, where I live,\u201d said the little prince, \u201cit is not very interesting.\n",
    "It is all so small.\nI have three \nvolcanoes.\nTwo volcanoes are active and the other is extinct.\nBut one never knows.\u201d \n",
    "\u201cOne never knows,\u201d said the geographer.\n\n\n\u201cI have also a flower.\u201d \n\n\n\u201cWe do not record flowers,\u201d said the geographer.\n",
    "\n\u201cWhy is that?\nThe flower is the most beautiful thing on my planet!\u201d \n\u201cWe do not record them,\u201d said the geographer, \u201cbecause they are ephemeral.\u201d \n",
    "\u201cWhat does that mean \u2018ephemeral\u2019?\u201d \n\u201cGeographies,\u201d said the geographer, \u201care the books which, of all books, are most concerned with \n",
    "matters of consequence.\nThey never become old-fashioned.\nIt is very rarely that a mountain \nchanges its position.\n",
    "It is very rarely that an ocean empties itself of its waters.\nWe write of eternal \nthings.\u201d \n\u201cBut extinct volcanoes may come to life again,\u201d the little prince interrupted.\n",
    "\n\u201cWhat does that mean \u2018ephemeral\u2019?\u201d \n\u201cWhether volcanoes are extinct or alive, it comes to the same thing for us,\u201d said the geographer.\n",
    "\u201cThe thing that matters to us is the mountain.\nIt does not change.\u201d \n\u201cBut what does that mean \u2018ephemeral\u2019?\u201d repeated the little prince, who never in his life had let go \n",
    "of a question, once he had asked it.\n\n\u201cIt means, \u2018which is in danger of speedy disappearance.\u2019 \u201c \n\u201cIs my flower in danger of speedy disappearance?\u201d \n",
    "\u201cCertainly it is.\u201d \n\u201cMy flower is ephemeral,\u201d the little prince said to himself, \u201cand she has only four thorns to \n",
    "defend herself against the world.\nAnd I have left her on my planet, all alone!\u201d \nThat was his first moment of regret.\n",
    "But he took courage once more.\n\u201cWhat place would you \nadvise me to visit now?\u201d he asked.\n\u201cThe planet Earth,\u201d replied the geographer.\n",
    "\u201cIt has a good \nreputation.\u201d And the little prince went away, thinking of his flower.\n\n\nSo then the seventh planet was the Earth.\n",
    "\nThe Earth is not just an ordinary planet!\n\nOne can count, there 111 kings (not forgetting, to be sure, the Negro kings among them), 7000 \n",
    "geographers, 900,000 businessmen, 7,500,000 tipplers, 311,000,000 conceited men, that is to say, \nabout 2,000,000,000 grown-ups.\n",
    "\nTo give you an idea of the size of the Earth, I will tell you that before the invention of electricity it \n",
    "was necessary to maintain, over the whole of the six continents, a veritable army of 462,511 \nlamplighters for the street lamps.\n",
    "Seen from a slight distance, that would make a splendid \nspectacle.\n\nThe movements of this army would be regulated like those of the ballet in the opera.\n",
    "First would \ncome the turn of the lamplighters of New Zealand and Australia.\nHaving set their lamps alight, \n",
    "these would go off to sleep.\nNext, the lamplighters of China and Siberia would enter for their steps \n",
    "in the dance, and then they too would be waved back into the wings.\nAfter that would come the \nturn of the lamplighters of Russia and the Indies; then those of Africa and Europe, then those of \n",
    "South America; then those of North America.\nAnd never would they make a mistake in the order \nof their entry upon the stage.\n",
    "It would be magnificent.\n\nOnly the man who was in charge of the single lamp at the North Pole, and his colleague who was \n",
    "responsible for the single lamp at the South Pole, only these two would live free from toil and \ncare: they would be busy twice a year.\n",
    "\nWhen one wishes to play the wit, he sometimes wanders a little from the truth.\n\nI have not been altogether honest in what I have told you about the lamplighters.\n",
    "And I realise \nthat I run the risk of giving a false idea of our planet to those who do not know it.\n",
    "\nMen occupy a very small place upon the Earth.\nIf the two billion inhabitants who people its \nsurface were all to stand upright and somewhat crowded together, as they do for some big public \n",
    "assembly, they could easily be put into one public square twenty miles long and twenty miles wide.\nAll humanity could be piled up on a small Pacific islet.\n",
    "\nThe grown-ups, to be sure, will not believe you when you tell them that.\nThey imagine that they fill \n",
    "a great deal of space.\nThey fancy themselves as important as the baobabs.\nYou should advise \nthem, then, to make their own calculations.\n",
    "They adore figures, and that will please them.\nBut do \nnot waste your time on this extra task.\nIt is unnecessary.\n",
    "You have, I know, confidence in me.\n\nWhen the little prince arrived on the Earth, he was very much surprised not to see any people.\n",
    "He \nwas beginning to be afraid he had come to the wrong planet, when a coil of gold, the colour of the \n",

    "And all roads lead to the abodes of men.\n\n\u201cGood morning,\u201d he said.\nHe was standing before a garden, all a-bloom with roses.\n",
    "\n\u201cGood morning,\u201d said the roses.\n\nThe little prince gazed at them.\nThey all looked like his flower.\n",
    "\n\u201cWho are you?\u201d he demanded, thunderstruck.\n\n\u201cWe are roses,\u201d the roses said.\nAnd he was overcome with sadness.\n",
    "His flower had told him that \nshe was the only one of her kind in all the universe.\nAnd here were five thousand of them, all \n",
    "alike, in one single garden!\n\n\u201cShe would be very much annoyed,\u201d he said to himself, \u201cif she should see that\u2026 she would cough \n",
    "\nmost dreadfully, and she would pretend that she was dying, to avoid being laughed at.\nAnd I \nshould be obliged to pretend that I was nursing her back to life, for if I did not do that, to humble \n",
    "myself also, she would really allow herself to die\u2026\u201d \nThen he went on with his reflections: \u201cI thought that I was rich, with a flower that was unique in all \n",
    "the world; and all I had was a common rose.\nA common rose, and three volcanoes that come up to \nmy knees \u2014 and one of them perhaps extinct forever\u2026 that doesn\u2019t make me a very great \n",
    "prince\u2026\u201d And he lay down in the grass and cried.\n\nIt was then that the fox appeared.\n\n\u201cGood morning,\u201d said the fox.\n",
    "\n\u201cGood morning,\u201d the little prince responded politely, although when he turned around he saw \nnothing.\n",
    "\n\u201cI am right here,\u201d the voice said, \u201cunder the apple tree.\u201d \u201c \nWho are you?\u201d asked the little prince, and added, \u201cYou are very pretty to look at.\u201d \n",
    "\u201cI am a fox,\u201d said the fox.\n\n\u201cCome and play with me,\u201d proposed the little prince.\n\n\u201cI am so unhappy.\u201d \u201cI cannot play with you,\u201d the fox said.\n",
    "\u201cI am not tamed.\u201d \n\u201cAh!\nPlease excuse me,\u201d said the little prince.\nBut, after some thought, he added: \u201cWhat does \n",
    "that mean, \u2018tame\u2019?\u201d \n\n\n\u201cYou do not live here,\u201d said the fox.\n\u201cWhat is it that you are looking for?\u201d \n",
    "\u201cI am looking for men,\u201d said the little prince.\n\u201cWhat does that mean, \u2018tame\u2019?\u201d \n\u201cMen,\u201d said the fox.\n",
    "\u201cThey have guns, and they hunt.\nIt is very disturbing.\nThey also raise \nchickens.\nThese are their only interests.\n",
    "Are you looking for chickens?\u201d \n\u201cNo,\u201d said the little prince.\n\u201cI am looking for friends.\nWhat does that mean, \u2018tame\u2019?\u201d \n",
    "\u201cIt is an act too often neglected,\u201d said the fox.\nIt means to establish ties.\u201d \n\n\u201c\u2018To establish ties\u2019?\u201d \n",
    "\n\u201cJust that,\u201d said the fox.\n\u201cTo me, you are still nothing more than a little boy who is just like a \n",
    "hundred thousand other little boys.\nAnd I have no need of you.\nAnd you, on your part, have no \nneed of me.\n",
    "To you, I am nothing more than a fox like a hundred thousand other foxes.\nBut if you \ntame me, then we shall need each other.\n",
    "To me, you will be unique in all the world.\nTo you, I shall \nbe unique in all the world\u2026\u201d \n\u201cI am beginning to understand,\u201d said the little prince.\n",
    "\u201cThere is a flower\u2026 I think that she has \ntamed me\u2026\u201d \n\u201cIt is possible,\u201d said the fox.\n\u201cOn the Earth one sees all sorts of things.\u201d \n",
    "\u201cOh, but this is not on the Earth!\u201d said the little prince.\nThe fox seemed perplexed, and very \ncurious.\n",
    "\n\u201cOn another planet?\u201d \n\u201cYes.\u201d \n\u201cAre there hunters on this planet?\u201d \n\u201cNo.\u201d \n\u201cAh, that is interesting!\n",
    "Are there chickens?\u201d \n\u201cNo.\u201d \n\u201cNothing is perfect,\u201d sighed the fox.\nBut he came back to his idea.\n\u201cMy life is very monotonous,\u201d \n",
    "the fox said.\n\u201cI hunt chickens; men hunt me.\nAll the chickens are just alike, and all the men are \njust alike.\n",
    "And, in consequence, I am a little bored.\nBut if you tame me, it will be as if the sun \ncame to shine on my life.\n",
    "I shall know the sound of a step that will be different from all the others.\nOther steps send me hurrying back underneath the ground.\n",
    "Yours will call me, like music, out of \nmy burrow.\nAnd then look: you see the grain-fields down yonder?\n",
    "I do not eat bread.\nWheat is of \nno use to me.\nThe wheat fields have nothing to say to me.\nAnd that is sad.\n",
    "But you have hair that \nis the colour of gold.\nThink how wonderful that will be when you have tamed me!\n",
    "The grain, which \nis also golden, will bring me back the thought of you.\nAnd I shall love to listen to the wind in the \n",
    "wheat\u2026\u201d The fox gazed at the little prince, for a long time.\n\u201cPlease, tame me!\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cI want to, very much,\u201d the little prince replied.\n",
    "\u201cBut I have not much time.\nI have friends to \ndiscover, and a great many things to understand.\u201d \n\u201cOne only understands the things that one tames,\u201d said the fox.\n",
    "\u201cMen have no more time to \nunderstand anything.\nThey buy things all ready-made at the shops.\nBut there is no shop anywhere \n",
    "where one can buy friendship, and so men have no friends any more.\nIf you want a friend, tame \nme\u2026\u201d \n",
    "\u201cWhat must I do, to tame you?\u201d asked the little prince.\n\n\u201cYou must be very patient,\u201d replied the fox.\n",
    "\u201cFirst you will sit down at a little distance from me, \nlike that, in the grass.\nI shall look at you out of the corner of my eye, and you will say nothing.\n",
    "Words are the source of misunderstandings.\nBut you will sit a little closer to me, every day\u2026\u201d \n\n\nThe next day the little prince came back.\n",
    "\n\n\u201cIt would have been better to come back at the same hour,\u201d said the fox.\n\u201cIf, for example, you \ncome at four o\u2019clock in the afternoon, then at three o\u2019clock I shall begin to be happy.\n",
    "I shall feel \nhappier and happier as the hour advances.\nAt four o\u2019clock, I shall already be worrying and \n",
    "jumping about.\nI shall show you how happy I am!\nBut if you come at just any time, I shall never \nknow at what hour my heart is to be ready to greet you\u2026 One must observe the proper rites\u2026\u201d \n",
    "\u201cWhat is a rite?\u201d asked the little prince.\n\n\u201cThose also are actions too often neglected,\u201d said the fox.\n",
    "\u201cThey are what make one day \ndifferent from other days, one hour from other hours.\nThere is a rite, for example, among my \n",
    "hunters.\nEvery Thursday they dance with the village girls.\nSo Thursday is a wonderful day for me!\nI can take a walk as far as the vineyards.\n",
    "But if the hunters danced at just any time, every day \nwould be like every other day, and I should never have any vacation at all.\u201d \n",
    "So the little prince tamed the fox.\nAnd when the hour of his departure drew near\u2026 \n\u201cAh,\u201d said the fox, \u201cI shall cry.\u201d \n",
    "\u201cIt is your own fault,\u201d said the little prince.\n\u201cI never wished you any sort of harm; but you wanted \n",
    "me to tame you\u2026\u201d \n\u201cYes, that is so,\u201d said the fox.\n\n\u201cBut now you are going to cry!\u201d said the little prince.\n",
    "\n\u201cYes, that is so,\u201d said the fox.\n\n\u201cThen it has done you no good at all!\u201d \n\u201cIt has done me good,\u201d said the fox, \u201cbecause of the colour of the wheat fields.\u201d And then he \n",
    "added: \u201cGo and look again at the roses.\nYou will understand now that yours is unique in all the \nworld.\n",
    "Then come back to say goodbye to me, and I will make you a present of a secret.\u201d \nThe little prince went away, to look again at the roses.\n",
    "\u201cYou are not at all like my rose,\u201d he said.\n\u201cAs yet you are nothing.\nNo one has tamed you, and you have tamed no one.\n",
    "You are like my fox \nwhen I first knew him.\nHe was only a fox like a hundred thousand other foxes.\nBut I have made \n",
    "him my friend, and now he is unique in all the world.\u201d And the roses were very much embarrassed.\n\u201cYou are beautiful, but you are empty,\u201d he went on.\n",
    "\u201cOne could not die for you.\nTo be sure, an \nordinary passer-by would think that my rose looked just like you, the rose that belongs to me.\n",
    "But \nin herself alone she is more important than all the hundreds of you other roses: because it is she \n",
    "that I have watered; because it is she that I have put under the glass globe; because it is she that \n",
    "I have sheltered behind the screen; because it is for her that I have killed the caterpillars (except \n",
    "the two or three that we saved to become butterflies); because it is she that I have listened to, \nwhen she grumbled, or boasted, or even sometimes when she said nothing.\n",
    "Because she is my \nrose.\n\nAnd he went back to meet the fox.\n\u201cGoodbye,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cGoodbye,\u201d said the fox.\n",
    "\u201cAnd now here is my secret, a very simple secret: It is only with the \nheart that one can see rightly; what is essential is invisible to the eye.\u201d \n",
    "\n\n\u201cWhat is essential is invisible to the eye,\u201d the little prince repeated, so that he would be sure to \n",
    "remember.\n\n\u201cIt is the time you have wasted for your rose that makes your rose so important.\u201d \n\u201cIt is the time I have wasted for my rose\u2026\u201d said the little prince, so that he would be sure to \n",
    "remember.\n\n\u201cMen have forgotten this truth,\u201d said the fox.\n\u201cBut you must not forget it.\nYou become \nresponsible, forever, for what you have tamed.\n",
    "You are responsible for your rose\u2026\u201d \n\u201cI am responsible for my rose,\u201d the little prince repeated, so that he would be sure to remember.\n",
    "\n\u201cGood morning,\u201d said the little prince.\n\n\u201cGood morning,\u201d said the railway switchman.\n\n\u201cWhat do you do here?\u201d the little prince asked.\n",
    "\n\u201cI sort out travellers, in bundles of a thousand,\u201d said the switchman.\n\u201cI send off the trains that \n",
    "carry them; now to the right, now to the left.\u201d And a brilliantly lighted express train shook the \nswitchman\u2019s cabin as it rushed by with a roar like thunder.\n",
    "\n\u201cThey are in a great hurry,\u201d said the little prince.\n\u201cWhat are they looking for?\u201d \n\u201cNot even the locomotive engineer knows that,\u201d said the switchman.\n",
    "And a second brilliantly \nlighted express thundered by, in the opposite direction.\n\n\u201cAre they coming back already?\u201d demanded the little prince.\n",
    "\u201cThese are not the same ones,\u201d said \nthe switchman.\n\u201cIt is an exchange.\u201d \n\u201cWere they not satisfied where they were?\u201d asked the little prince.\n",
    "\n\u201cNo one is ever satisfied where he is,\u201d said the switchman.\nAnd they heard the roaring thunder of \n",
    "a third brilliantly lighted express.\n\n\u201cAre they pursuing the first travellers?\u201d demanded the little prince.\n",
    "\n\u201cThey are pursuing nothing at all,\u201d said the switchman.\n\u201cThey are asleep in there, or if they are \n",
    "not asleep they are yawning.\nOnly the children are flattening their noses against the \nwindowpanes.\u201d \n",
    "\u201cOnly the children know what they are looking for,\u201d said the little prince.\n\n\u201cThey waste their time over a rag doll and it becomes very important to them; and if anybody \n",
    "takes it away from them, they cry\u2026\u201d \u201cThey are lucky,\u201d the switchman said.\n\n\u201cGood morning,\u201d said the little prince.\n",
    "\n\u201cGood morning,\u201d said the merchant.\n\nThis was a merchant who sold pills that had been invented to quench thirst.\n",
    "You need only swallow \none pill a week, and you would feel no need of anything to drink.\n\n\n\u201cWhy are you selling those?\u201d asked the little prince.\n",
    "\n\n\u201cBecause they save a tremendous amount of time,\u201d said the merchant.\n\u201cComputations have been \nmade by experts.\n",
    "With these pills, you save fifty-three minutes in every week.\u201d \n\u201cAnd what do I do with those fifty-three minutes?\u201d \n",
    "\u201cAnything you like\u2026\u201d \n\u201cAs for me,\u201d said the little prince to himself, \u201cif I had fifty-three minutes to spend as I liked, I \n",
    "should walk at my leisure toward a spring of fresh water.\u201d \nIt was now the eighth day since I had had my accident in the desert, and I had listened to the story \n",
    "of the merchant as I was drinking the last drop of my water supply.\n\n\u201cAh,\u201d I said to the little prince, \u201cthese memories of yours are very charming; but I have not yet \n",
    "succeeded in repairing my plane; I have nothing more to drink; and I, too, should be very happy if \n",
    "I could walk at my leisure toward a spring of fresh water!\u201d \n\u201cMy friend the fox\u2026\u201d the little prince said to me.\n",
    "\n\u201cMy dear little man, this is no longer a matter that has anything to do with the fox!\u201d \n\u201cWhy not?\u201d \n",
    "\u201cBecause I am about to die of thirst\u2026\u201d \nHe did not follow my reasoning, and he answered me: \u201cIt is a good thing to have had a friend, \n",
    "even if one is about to die.\nI, for instance, am very glad to have had a fox as a friend\u2026\u201d \n\u201cHe has no way of guessing the danger,\u201d I said to myself.\n",
    "\u201cHe has never been either hungry or \nthirsty.\nA little sunshine is all he needs\u2026\u201d \nBut he looked at me steadily, and replied to my thought: \u201cI am thirsty, too.\n",
    "Let us look for a \nwell\u2026\u201d I made a gesture of weariness.\nIt is absurd to look for a well, at random, in the immensity \n",
    "of the desert.\nBut nevertheless we started walking.\n\nWhen we had trudged along for several hours, in silence, the darkness fell, and the stars began to \n",
    "come out.\nThirst had made me a little feverish, and I looked at them as if I were in a dream.\nThe \nlittle prince\u2019s last words came reeling back into my memory: \u201cThen you are thirsty, too?\u201d I \n",
    "demanded.\nBut he did not reply to my question.\nHe merely said to me: \u201cWater may also be good \nfor the heart\u2026\u201d \n",
    "I did not understand this answer, but I said nothing.\nI knew very well that it was impossible to \ncross-examine him.\n",
    "He was tired.\nHe sat down.\nI sat down beside him.\nAnd, after a little silence, \nhe spoke again: \u201cThe stars are beautiful, because of a flower that cannot be seen.\u201d \n",
    "I replied, \u201cYes, that is so.\u201d And, without saying anything more, I looked across the ridges of sand \n",
    "that were stretched out before us in the moonlight.\n\n\u201cThe desert is beautiful,\u201d the little prince added.\n",
    "\nAnd that was true.\nI have always loved the desert.\nOne sits down on a desert sand dune, sees \n\n\nnothing, hears nothing.\n",
    "Yet through the silence something throbs, and gleams\u2026 \n\u201cWhat makes the desert beautiful,\u201d said the little prince, \u201cis that somewhere it hides a well\u2026\u201d \n",
    "I was astonished by a sudden understanding of that mysterious radiation of the sands.\nWhen I was \na little boy I lived in an old house, and legend told us that a treasure was buried there.\n",
    "To be sure, \nno one had ever known how to find it; perhaps no one had ever even looked for it.\nBut it cast an \n",
    "enchantment over that house.\nMy home was hiding a secret in the depths of its heart\u2026 \u201cYes,\u201d I \nsaid to the little prince.\n",
    "\u201cThe house, the stars, the desert \u2014 what gives them their beauty is \nsomething that is invisible!\u201d \n",
    "\u201cI am glad,\u201d he said, \u201cthat you agree with my fox.\u201d As the little prince dropped off to sleep, I took \n",
    "him in my arms and set out walking once more.\nI felt deeply moved, and stirred.\nIt seemed to me \nthat I was carrying a very fragile treasure.\n",
    "It seemed to me, even, that there was nothing more \nfragile on all Earth.\nIn the moonlight I looked at his pale forehead, his closed eyes, his locks of \n",
    "hair that trembled in the wind, and I said to myself: \n\u201cWhat I see here is nothing but a shell.\nWhat is most important is invisible\u2026\u201d \n",
    "As his lips opened slightly with the suspicious of a half-smile, I said to myself, again: \u201cWhat \nmoves me so deeply, about this little prince who is sleeping here, is his loyalty to a flower \u2014 the \n",
    "image of a rose that shines through his whole being like the flame of a lamp, even when he is \nasleep\u2026\u201d \n",
    "And I felt him to be more fragile still.\nI felt the need of protecting him, as if he himself were a \n",
    "flame that might be extinguished by a little puff of wind\u2026 And, as I walked on so, I found the well, \n",
    "at daybreak.\n\n\u201cMen,\u201d said the little prince, \u201cset out on their way in express trains, but they do not know what \n",
    "they are looking for.\nThen they rush about, and get excited, and turn round and round\u2026\u201d And he \nadded: \u201cIt is not worth the trouble\u2026\u201d \n",
    "\nThe well that we had come to was not like the wells of the Sahara.\nThe wells of the Sahara are \nmere holes dug in the sand.\n",
    "This one was like a well in a village.\nBut there was no village here, \nand I thought I must be dreaming\u2026 \n",
    "\u201cIt is strange,\u201d I said to the little prince.\n\u201cEverything is ready for use: the pulley, the bucket, the \n",
    "rope\u2026\u201d He laughed, touched the rope, and set the pulley to working.\nAnd the pulley moaned, like \nan old weathervane, which the wind has long since forgotten.\n",
    "\n\u201cDo you hear?\u201d said the little prince.\n\u201cWe have wakened the well, and it is singing\u2026\u201d \nI did not want him to tire himself with the rope.\n",
    "\n\u201cLeave it to me,\u201d I said.\n\u201cIt is too heavy for you.\u201d I hoisted the bucket slowly to the edge of the \n",
    "well and set it there, happy, tired as I was, over my achievement.\nThe song of the pulley was still \n",
    "in my ears, and I could see the sunlight shimmer in the still trembling water.\n\n\u201cI am thirsty for this water,\u201d said the little prince.\n",
    "\u201cGive me some of it to drink\u2026\u201d \nAnd I understood what he had been looking for.\nI raised the bucket to his lips.\n",
    "He drank, his eyes \nclosed.\nIt was as sweet as some special festival treat.\nThis water was indeed a different thing from \n",
    "ordinary nourishment.\nIts sweetness was born of the walk under the stars, the song of the pulley, \nthe effort of my arms.\n",
    "It was good for the heart, like a present.\nWhen I was a little boy, the lights \nof the Christmas tree, the music of the Midnight Mass, the tenderness of smiling faces, used to \n",
    "make up, so, the radiance of the gifts I received.\n\n\u201cThe men where you live,\u201d said the little prince, \u201craise five thousand roses in the same garden \n",
    "and they do not find in it what they are looking for.\u201d \n\u201cThey do not find it,\u201d I replied.\n\n\u201cAnd yet what they are looking for could be found in one single rose, or in a little water.\u201d \n",
    "\u201cYes, that is true,\u201d I said.\n\nAnd the little prince added: \u201cBut the eyes are blind.\nOne must look with the heart\u2026\u201d \n",
    "I had drunk the water.\nI breathed easily.\nAt sunrise the sand is the colour of honey.\nAnd that \nhoney colour was making me happy, too.\n",
    "What brought me, then, this sense of grief?\n\n\u201cYou must keep your promise,\u201d said the little prince, softly, as he sat down beside me once more.\n",
    "\u201cWhat promise?\u201d \u201cYou know, a muzzle for my sheep\u2026 I am responsible for this flower\u2026\u201d \nI took my rough drafts of drawings out of my pocket.\n",
    "The little prince looked them over, and \nlaughed as he said: \n\u201cYour baobabs, they look a little like cabbages.\u201d \n",
    "\u201cOh!\u201d I had been so proud of my baobabs!\n\u201cYour fox, his ears look a little like horns; and they are \n",
    "too long.\u201d And he laughed again.\n\n\u201cYou are not fair, little prince,\u201d I said.\n\u201cI don\u2019t know how to draw anything except boa constrictors \n",
    "from the outside and boa constrictors from the inside.\u201d \n\n\n\u201cOh, that will be all right,\u201d he said, \u201cchildren understand.\u201d \n",
    "So then I made a pencil sketch of a muzzle.\nAnd as I gave it to him my heart was torn.\n\n\u201cYou have plans that I do not know about,\u201d I said.\n",
    "But he did not answer me.\nHe said to me, \ninstead: \u201cYou know, my descent to the earth\u2026 Tomorrow will be its anniversary.\u201d Then, after a \n",
    "silence, he went on: \u201cI came down very near here.\u201d And he flushed.\n\nAnd once again, without understanding why, I had a queer sense of sorrow.\n",
    "One question, \nhowever, occurred to me: \u201cThen it was not by chance that on the morning when I first met you \u2014 a \n",
    "week ago \u2014 you were strolling along like that, all alone, a thousand miles from any inhabited \nregion?\n",
    "You were on the your way back to the place where you landed?\u201d \nThe little prince flushed again.\nAnd I added, with some hesitancy: \u201cPerhaps it was because of the \n",
    "anniversary?\u201d The little prince flushed once more.\nHe never answered questions, but when one \nflushes does that not mean \u201cYes\u201d?\n",
    "\n\u201cAh,\u201d I said to him, \u201cI am a little frightened\u2026\u201d \nBut he interrupted me.\n\u201cNow you must work.\nYou must return to your engine.\n",
    "I will be waiting for \nyou here.\nCome back tomorrow evening\u2026\u201d \nBut I was not reassured.\nI remembered the fox.\n",
    "One runs the risk of weeping a little, if one lets \nhimself be tamed\u2026 \nBeside the well there was the ruin of an old stone wall.\n",
    "When I came back from my work, the next \nevening, I saw from some distance away my little prince sitting on top of a wall, with his feet \n",
    "dangling.\nAnd I heard him say: \u201cThen you don\u2019t remember.\nThis is not the exact spot.\u201d Another \nvoice must have answered him, for he replied to it: \u201cYes, yes!\n",
    "It is the right day, but this is not the \nplace.\u201d \nI continued my walk toward the wall.\nAt no time did I see or hear anyone.\n",
    "The little prince, \nhowever, replied once again: \u201c\u2026Exactly.\nYou will see where my track begins, in the sand.\n",
    "You have \nnothing to do but wait for me there.\nI shall be there tonight.\u201d \n\nI was only twenty metres from the wall, and I still saw nothing.\n",
    "After a silence the little prince \nspoke again: \u201cYou have good poison?\nYou are sure that it will not make me suffer too long?\u201d I \n",
    "stopped in my tracks, my heart torn asunder; but still I did not understand.\n\u201cNow go away,\u201d said \nthe little prince.\n",
    "\u201cI want to get down from the wall.\u201d \nI dropped my eyes, then, to the foot of the wall\u2026 and I leaped into the air.\n",
    "There before me, facing \nthe little prince, was one of those yellow snakes that take just thirty seconds to bring your life to \n",
    "an end.\nEven as I was digging into my pocked to get out my revolver I made a running step back.\nBut, at the noise I made, the snake let himself flow easily across the sand like the dying spray of \n",
    "a fountain, and, in no apparent hurry, disappeared, with a light metallic sound, among the stones.\nI \n",
    "reached the wall just in time to catch my little man in my arms; his face was white as snow.\n\n\u201cWhat does this mean?\u201d I demanded.\n",
    "\u201cWhy are you talking with snakes?\u201d \nI had loosened the golden muffler that he always wore.\nI had moistened his temples, and had \n",
    "given him some water to drink.\nAnd now I did not dare ask him any more questions.\nHe looked at \nme very gravely, and put his arms around my neck.\n",
    "I felt his heart beating like the heart of a \ndying bird, shot with someone\u2019s rifle\u2026 \n\u201cI am glad that you have found what was the matter with your engine,\u201d he said.\n",
    "\u201cNow you can go \nback home\u201d \n\u201cHow do you know about that?\u201d I was just coming to tell him that my work had been successful, \n",
    "beyond anything that I had dared to hope.\n\nHe made no answer to my question, but he added: \u201cI, too, am going back home today\u2026\u201d Then, \n",
    "sadly, \u201cIt is much farther\u2026 it is much more difficult\u2026\u201d I realised clearly that something \nextraordinary was happening.\n",
    "I was holding him close in my arms as if he were a little child; and \nyet it seemed to me that he was rushing headlong toward an abyss from which I could do nothing \n",
    "to restrain him\u2026 His look was very serious, like some one lost far away.\n\n\u201cI have your sheep.\nAnd I have the sheep\u2019s box.\n",
    "And I have the muzzle\u2026\u201d \nAnd he gave me a sad smile.\nI waited a long time.\nI could see that he was reviving little by little.\n",
    "\n\u201cDear little man,\u201d I said to him, \u201cyou are afraid\u2026\u201d He was afraid, there was no doubt about that.\nBut he laughed lightly.\n",
    "\n\u201cI shall be much more afraid this evening\u2026\u201d \nOnce again I felt myself frozen by the sense of something irreparable.\n",
    "And I knew that I could not \nbear the thought of never hearing that laughter any more.\nFor me, it was like a spring of fresh \n",
    "water in the desert.\n\n\u201cLittle man,\u201d I said, \u201cI want to hear you laugh again.\u201d But he said to me: \u201cTonight, it will be a \n",
    "year\u2026 my star, then, can be found right above the place where I came to the Earth, a year ago\u2026\u201d \n",
    "\u201cLittle man,\u201d I said, \u201ctell me that it is only a bad dream, this affair of the snake, and the meeting- \n",
    "place, and the star\u2026\u201d But he did not answer my plea.\n\nHe said to me, instead: \u201cThe thing that is important is the thing that is not seen\u2026\u201d \u201cYes, I \n",
    "know\u2026\u201d \n\n\n\u201cIt is just as it is with the flower.\nIf you love a flower that lives on a star, it is sweet to look at the \n",
    "sky at night.\nAll the stars are a-bloom with flowers\u2026\u201d \n\u201cYes, I know\u2026\u201d \n\u201cIt is just as it is with the water.\n",
    "Because of the pulley, and the rope, what you gave me to drink \nwas like music.\nYou remember, how good it was.\u201d \n",
    "\u201cYes, I know\u2026\u201d \n\u201cAnd at night you will look up at the stars.\nWhere I live everything is so small that I cannot show \n",
    "you where my star is to be found.\nIt is better, like that.\nMy star will just be one of the stars, for \n",
    "you.\nAnd so you will love to watch all the stars in the heavens\u2026 they will all be your friends.\nAnd, \n",
    "besides, I am going to make you a present\u2026\u201d He laughed again.\n\n\u201cAh, little prince, dear little prince!\n",
    "I love to hear that laughter!\u201d \n\u201cThat is my present.\nJust that.\nIt will be as it was when we drank the water\u2026\u201d \n",
    "\u201cWhat are you trying to say?\u201d \n\u201cAll men have the stars,\u201d he answered, \u201cbut they are not the same things for different people.\n",
    "For \nsome, who are travellers, the stars are guides.\nFor others they are no more than little lights in the \n",
    "sky.\nFor others, who are scholars, they are problems.\nFor my businessman they were wealth.\nBut \nall these stars are silent.\n",
    "You, you alone, will have the stars as no one else has them\u201d \n\u201cWhat are you trying to say?\u201d \n\u201cIn one of the stars I shall be living.\n",
    "In one of them I shall be laughing.\nAnd so it will be as if all \nthe stars were laughing, when you look at the sky at night\u2026 you, only you, will have stars that can \n",
    "laugh!\u201d \nAnd he laughed again.\n\u201cAnd when your sorrow is comforted (time soothes all sorrows) you will be \n",
    "content that you have known me.\nYou will always be my friend.\nYou will want to laugh with me.\nAnd \nyou will sometimes open your window, so, for that pleasure\u2026 and your friends will be properly \n",
    "astonished to see you laughing as you look up at the sky!\nThen you will say to them, \u2018Yes, the \nstars always make me laugh!\u2019 And they will think you are crazy.\n",
    "It will be a very shabby trick that \nI shall have played on you\u2026\u201d \nAnd he laughed again.\n\u201cIt will be as if, in place of the stars, I had given you a great number of \n",
    "little bells that knew how to laugh\u2026\u201d \nAnd he laughed again.\nThen he quickly became serious: \u201cTonight, you know\u2026 do not come,\u201d said \n",
    "the little prince.\n\n\u201cI shall not leave you,\u201d I said.\n\n\u201cI shall look as if I were suffering.\nI shall look a little as if I were dying.\n",
    "It is like that.\nDo not \ncome to see that.\nIt is not worth the trouble\u2026\u201d \n\u201cI shall not leave you.\u201d \n",
    "\nBut he was worried.\n\u201cI tell you, it is also because of the snake.\nHe must not bite you.\nSnakes, they \n",
    "\n\nare malicious creatures.\nThis one might bite you just for fun\u2026\u201d \n\n\u201cI shall not leave you.\u201d \nBut a thought came to reassure him: \u201cIt is true that they have no more poison for a second bite.\u201d \n",
    "That night I did not see him set out on his way.\nHe got away from me without making a sound.\nWhen I succeeded in catching up with him he was walking along with a quick and resolute step.\n",
    "He \nsaid to me merely: \u201cAh!\nYou are there\u2026\u201d And he took me by the hand.\nBut he was still worrying.\n\u201cIt was wrong of you to come.\n",
    "You will suffer.\nI shall look as if I were dead; and that will not be \ntrue\u2026\u201d \nI said nothing.\n\n\u201cYou understand\u2026 it is too far.\n",
    "I cannot carry this body with me.\nIt is too heavy.\u201d \nI said nothing.\n\n\u201cBut it will be like an old abandoned shell.\n",
    "There is nothing sad about old shells\u2026\u201d \nI said nothing.\nHe was a little discouraged.\nBut he made one more effort: \u201cYou know, it will be \n",
    "very nice.\nI, too, shall look at the stars.\nAll the stars will be wells with a rusty pulley.\nAll the stars \n",
    "will pour out fresh water for me to drink\u2026\u201d \nI said nothing.\n\n\u201cThat will be so amusing!\nYou will have five hundred million little bells, and I shall have five \n",
    "hundred million springs of fresh water\u2026\u201d And he too said nothing more, because he was crying\u2026 \n\u201cHere it is.\n",
    "Let me go on by myself.\u201d And he sat down, because he was afraid.\nThen he said, \nagain: \u201cYou know, my flower\u2026 I am responsible for her.\n",
    "And she is so weak!\nShe has four thorns, \nof no use at all, to protect herself against all the world\u2026\u201d \n",
    "I too sat down, because I was not able to stand up any longer.\n\u201cThere now, that is all\u2026\u201d \nHe still hesitated a little; then he got up.\n",
    "He took one step.\nI could not move.\nThere was nothing \nbut a flash of yellow close to his ankle.\nHe remained motionless for an instant.\n",
    "He did not cry out.\nHe fell as gently as a tree falls.\nThere was not even any sound, because of the sand.\n",
    "\nAnd now six years have already gone by\u2026 I have never yet told this story.\n\nThe companions who met me on my return were well content to see me alive.\n",
    "I was sad, but I told \nthem: \u201cI am tired.\u201d Now my sorrow is comforted a little.\nThat is to say, not entirely.\n",
    "But I know \nthat he did go back to his planet, because I did not find his body at daybreak.\nIt was not such a \n",
    "heavy body\u2026 and at night I love to listen to the stars.\nIt is like five hundred million little bells\u2026 \n",
    "But there is one extraordinary thing\u2026 when I drew the muzzle for the little prince, I forgot to add \n",
    "the leather strap to it.\nHe will never have been able to fasten it on his sheep.\n\nSo now I keep wondering: what is happening on his planet?\n",
    "Perhaps the sheep has eaten the \nflower\u2026 At one time I say to myself: \u201cSurely not!\nThe little prince shuts his flower under her glass \n",
    "globe every night, and he watches over his sheep very carefully\u2026\u201d Then I am happy.\nAnd there is \nsweetness in the laughter of all the stars.\n",
    "\n\nBut at another time I say to myself: \u201cAt some moment or other one is absent-minded, and that is \nenough!\n",
    "On some one evening he forgot the glass globe, or the sheep got out, without making any \nnoise, in the night\u2026\u201d And then the little bells are changed to tears\u2026 Here, then, is a great \n",
    "mystery.\n\nFor you who also love the little prince, and for me, nothing in the universe can be the same if \n",
    "somewhere, we do not know where, a sheep that we never saw has eaten a rose\u2026 Look up at the \nsky.\nAsk yourselves: is it yes or no?\n",
    "\nHas the sheep eaten the flower?\nAnd you will see how everything changes\u2026 And no grown-up will \never understand that this is a matter of so much importance!\n",
    "This is, to me, the loveliest and \nsaddest landscape in the world.\nIt is the same as that on the preceding page, but I have drawn it \n",
    "again to impress it on your memory.\nIt is here that the little prince appeared on Earth, and \ndisappeared.\n",
    "Look at it carefully so that you will be sure to recognise it in case you travel some \nday to the African desert.\n",
    "And, if you should come upon this spot, please do not hurry on.\nWait for \na time, exactly under the star.\n",
    "Then, if a little man appears who laughs, who has golden hair and \nwho refuses to answer questions, you will know who he is.\n",
    "If this should happen, please comfort \nme.\nSend me word that he has come back.\n\n"
